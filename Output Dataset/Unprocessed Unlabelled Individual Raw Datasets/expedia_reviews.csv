ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,"We have stayed at the ARIA exclusively for years and have always been more than happy. This time was disappointing to say the least. We checked into a “clean and sanitized” room that was so dirty we asked to be moved after our 11:00 pm check in; only to be moved to a room that not only was there dried rice as hair stuck to the side of the chair- the room controls did not work. The lights would turn off and on randomly throughout the night. We called down to the front desk 3 different times to have this looked at and after 45 min cancelled the request-deciding that eye masks were better than waiting indefinitely for maintenance to show up. As I said, ARIA has been our only choice of resorts for as long as they have been open but we will be actively looking for a new place to call…"
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,Great location and very nice place to stay overall. Needs in room fridge and microwave for guests. Staff was friendly. Javier’s which is located inside was great. Staff there was friendly and food was great.
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,Hotel was very clean staff was very professional and always willing to help and no problems would definitely stay there again The only bad thing I would say is that I wish there was a coffee maker in the room would’ve been great but everything else was fine
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,"Great and cozy rooms comfortable mattress, I missed the buffet due to pandemic situation but it is understandable, I always stay at this hotel first time I got a rear view facing new stadium, back noise from a/c units, kind of noisy for my taste, but other than that great place "
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,The whole experience was like know other during my time visiting Vegas. Thanks for make this weekend the best. I will return in January or February if it is Gods will. Next trip will be a better one I am sure.
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,I was lied to insulted treated poorly and my room was never cleaned. I was promised a food and beverage credit and Free play which I was refused after I checked in.  The Valet was rude nonsensical and allowed some people privileges and some not. He threatened to tow My car and refused to give me his name. His Manager came out refused to give his name and threatened to tow my car and then asks my name!!!!! I have a Platinum and was promised free parking!!! They allowed friends and co workers to park and refused me threatened to tow me. When the spot is specifically designated for Platinum Players! ARIA Does not want you or your business!!!!
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,The ARIA was the best resort experience I ever had. Many amenities and rooms are exceptionally clean. I experienced no issues at all. Staff being alert on who is allowed on elevators to the room gave me a sense of security. 
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,"Another great experience at ARIA, personnel are friendly and helpful for any questions or requests and casino is very COVID conscious and polite if you aren’t following protocol that is required by MGM properties "
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,Everything was ok except for the cleanliness. A film of dust coated the tables and the toilet. One of the fake eyelashes stick on my feet while I was walking on the carpet. PS: I don’t use fake eyelashes.
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,Great location and COVID compliant and a variety of restaurants. I did not win any $$$ and Did not see anyone winning either. Overall a great place to stay. I will definitely stay here again. Oh and the bed was perfect!!
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,Gym has limited hours. Can’t use fridge for personal water soda  Lights in room are weird.  Hard to navigate  1/2 the restaurants closed or limited hours. Staff bit friendly. Check in took forever. Won’t stay again. 
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,Fair price for fair service and amenities. House keepers invading several times during my last trip to ARIA. Staff experience was fair overall. Nothing positive worth remembering or noting here. So fair is how I can done it all up.  
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,"The room was absolutely beautiful, with a great view of the strip.  The bathroom was really cool and had a large shower with a bath tub right next to, but within the glass shower walls.  I was able to fill up the bath for my wife and wash my balls while she bathed, it was very romantic.  The casino has a very nice feel with friendly dealers.  I was able to walk out of there up, along with the sports bet that I placed.  I would definitely recommend this hotel and casino to friends and family."
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,"Over all stay was great, checking in took a little long, room was fairly clean, with the exception of the shower floor. Everyone was friendly and willing to help. Nice hotel for a weekend getaway. I would stay again"
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,First trip to Vegas in a while. Was not expecting the crowd and all additional precautions by the hotel and casino. Stay was great and views from the room could not be beat. Felt safe and comfortable from check in to check out.
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,"Over time I’ve stayed at the ARIA, and have been pleasantly surprised by my experience staying there. This last trip disappointed me. The rooms are cheap due to the Covid and lack of people traveling. Room was clean besides the public hair I found in the bed. The hotel guest room floors smell of Marijuana which bothered me and the neighbors on both sides of me were externally loud. The walls seemed to be paper thin. I do appreciate the attentiveness of the staff at the hotel. But my experiences at the property have definitely shown a decline in the clientele staying at the hotel."
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,My trip started off with the rude employees at check in. Then they took it upon themselves to turn off my charm thing privileges when I was at 30% of my charges and I got denied at dinner and bar. Had to call to get privileges lifted durning dinner in which I was on hold for 45 mins 
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,"Rooms were very nice, casino exceptionally clean. Limited table and slots. Table limits were exceptionally high even on a sunday night. NO one was playing due to high table limits. went to different casino to gamble. "
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,this was our first time staying at the ARIA.  Everything was lovely.  The room was clean.  The cleaning staff was great.  And the guests were quiet. Their pool staff was exceptional.  The Covid security made sure all the guest were abiding by the rules and made sure we knew what they were.
ARIA Resort & Casino,Expedia,"This is not my first stay with ARIA. I like this hotel because it is modern and clean. I had a special request for a refrigerator in my room for my medication and they had the refrigerator there within 15 minutes of arrival. I enjoy the Alibi, Javier's and the Lobby Bar. The only complaint I have is the strong marijuana smell throughout the hotel and guest room corridors even on non-smoking floors. I actually stayed at another property during my visit and this was not an issue so ARIA may need to take proper precautions either with better filtration or mirror other hotel protocols."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"My brothers and I ate lunch at the Four Seasons while in Vegas on a golf trip. It was a Sunday, so they had a brunch going that looked excellent, though a little pricey at $42. They also allowed ordering off the breakfast or lunch menus. We all ordered off the lunch menu. We had shrimp tacos, a steak sandwich (which was served with dill pickle fries) and a shrimp/scallop/pasta dish. Two of us had tap beers and the third had a glass of wine. Service was very attentive, the food was tasty, portions were generous and the setting was quite nice. The bill was $144, so you are paying a premium for what you get. If cost is not a concern, you will enjoy the Four Season."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"This hotel is for the discriminating guest who wishes to have a smoke free envirnoment as well as no Casino inhouse  With that said, there is direct access off the elevator to the Casino at the neighboring hotel.  You cant access the Casino easily and back into the hotel with a Four Season Hotel key.   Love the security at the hotel elevator.  Dining for breakfast, lunch and dinner is marevlous.  The bedding is luxerious.  THE place to stay in Las Vegas.  "
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"We stayed in a strip view upgrade  Pros - I Can’t say it enough but the staff is super friendly, something about a smile at every corner makes you feel great.  - Beautifully Decorated Lobby  - Bed and Sheets were amazing, clean, comfortable and the bed was wow.  - Bathroom toiletries amazing wouldn’t expect any less from the Four Seasons.   Although the room was nice I struggled with giving this property anything better than Average. With past experiences staying at Four Seasons properties this was a very average stay.   Cons - Room upkeep from outlets coming out of the wall, burnout lighting in the bathroom to what looked like warped ceiling with cracks. - Rooms were much smaller than expected  - Noise level from the hall in the morning time was a bit ridiculous. Typically in…"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,Wow.  Service that is on-par with top luxury cruise lines.  Attuned service.  Unobtrusive housekeeping staff that is available throughout the day.  Pristine and clean.  Cannot put a price on being treated well... A++++
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"The hotel truly lives up to the Four Seasons brand, it offers courteous service, great amenities and a sense of peace and calm. The best place to stay in Las Vegas if your goal is luxury. We stayed at this hotel several times over the years and it never disappoints!"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"We booked this hotel as we wanted a non gaming and non smoking hotel to get some R&R from the chaos of Las Vegas. A really good choice, location is at the end of the strip but if you want somewhere to go back to and get some peace and quiet it’s perfect. Easy to get around by taxi, tram or walking. If you want a casino it’s next door via a connecting door. Staff really friendly and helpful. Press is a lovely coffee bar and has breakfast items available from 530am."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"This hotel is out of this world! Faultless, high luxury, totally fantastic! I know it sounds over the top but ... it’s true! Porters are very welcoming and helpful, receptionists and concierges the same: nothing is too much trouble, you are really made feel special and valued by all staff. Reception and common areas are extremely elegant and the bedrooms ... are to die for! Great views (the Four Seasons is located on the top floors of the Mandalay Bay/ separate entrance) extremely spacious exquisitely decorated rooms, super comfortable beds, enormous elegant bathroom, mega huge TV, high speed WiFi ... perfection taken to the finest degree. The price isn’t modest but it is totally justified, every cent of it. I stayed two nights and wish I could stay forever. Highly recommend to…"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,I have zero complaints with the hotel amenities and none with the staff. The entire stay was great with respect to the accommodations.  They have earned my recommendation and we will be back again soon.
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,The four seasons occupies a few floors of the mandalay bay building at the end of the strip. Rooms have a great view and service is excellent. This was one one of the nicer hotels we have stayed in recently with excellent pillows and a bed so comfy that we didn’t want to leave it. Super nice bathroom too.
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"Every Four Seasons always confirms my choise is right. Perfect location and atmosphere with best service. Whenever I stay at Four Seasons, it makes me comfortable and pride of being a guest of hotel. Four Seasons know what ""Customer"" meas."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,I had high expectations for this hotel and was there  for a business event my company was running  at the four seasons Vegas. The first thing that was annoying was finding my way around. Sometimes I would wind up at the adjoining hotel just by going up the wrong stairway or from the elevator. It was very very confusing  to get around. The lighting in the rooms are very dim and room in general was outdated. I did like the food so that was the only redeeming quality for this hotel.
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,Stayed here for three days right after Christmas as part of a family reunion type of weekend. The room and bed were very comfortable - the shower & bathroom very spacious - and the towels and robe more than adequate.   Had drinks at the bar one night and ordered appetizers - received prompt and attentive service as well as at the little coffee area right in the lobby area.  Family ate at the restaurant upon arrival to use up a food credit - nice meal although the service was just a little bit slow.  This is a very nice hotel with the small but nicely appointed fitness area.
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"Fabulous service, beautiful guest rooms, comfortable beds.  Only drawback was lack of off-season swimming pool on facility.  Pool was offered at Mandalay Bay, but seemed a bit inconvenient.  Overall, we would highly recommend this facility. "
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"Stayed here a few times and love it!  Quiet, great room, amazing bed, COLD Air Conditioner... The only complaint is the In-Room Dining is SO SLOW it's agonizing!   Plan ahead and even if you want a snack, prepare to wait an hour!"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"We had a great stay at the hotel. I have stayed at many other hotels on the strip, but this was my first time at the Four Seasons. Our room was on the 37th floor and the views of the strip were great.   The rooms were nice and housekeeping was outstanding.   Breakfast was top notch—I think the buffet is only available on the weekends.  The doughnuts were very good.   There is no casino in the hotel but there is a Four Seasons elevator that can take you to the Mandalay Bay casino.  It was very easy to get to the casino.   If you have AMEX Platinum, I recommend booking the hotel through AMEX Fine Hotels & Resorts. "
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,We think anybody who works in service or cherishes service should stay at Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas! The really LIVE service and are a stellar model for service.  At such a place you get a notion of the true meaning of PARADISE.
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"I always must travel for a work conference, and this year was in Vegas. My first time, so I did not know much about city. 4Seasons was on southern most point of city. Major pluses were: near convention center, sushi options were numerous, concierge was one of the best I have ever worked with, and everything was super clean. I would say if you are a budget traveler, the whole city is going to be a challenge. 4Seasons was not the cheapest option, but I would definitely stay there again."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"The Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas offers their usual luxury accommodations and fantastic service and it is nice to be away from the madness, smoke and noises of the casinos.  Although physically part of the Mandalay Bay Resort, the Four Seasons has its own porte-cochere entry as well as a restricted entry to the central lobby of the Mandalay Bay. One feels very safe with all the personnel on duty and everyone from the doorman to the housekeepers are cordial and welcoming. You will get a good night's rest and the walls are so thick and insulated that you will not hear your neighbors at all. Web check-in makes the process go faster and checkout was a breeze."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"Beautiful, quite Las Vegas Hotel, It was nice to not be part of the ""herd"" in other Las Vegas resorts. Staff was very friendlyand  personable and the concierge department helped us to find shows and dinners that were great experiences. Best , quiet sleep ever in a Vegas hotel. Overall loved it and would definitely stay here again. In the past, my wife and I would always choose a different vegas resort to experience.. From now on, I will sleep here and visit the others during the day. This was our  7th different resort in the last  few years. Again Highly Recommend"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"The service is fantastic and the rooms are perfect, as are most Four Seasons properties, but the one reason I will be back again and again is that I won't be forced to walk through a casino filled with the smell of smoke!"
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,"If you want to get passed around by hotel staff, forced to fix their mistakes, and run around on ypir check out day to ensure you're not being overcharged, then this is the place for you! Very disappointed. This was my favorite at strip casino once upon a time but man have they gone downhill."
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,Over all we had a great time.  Everyone was so helpful and friendly.   The only down fall was 11:00 am early check in.  We planned our arrival time based on early check-in and we did not get a room until 2:00 pm.  
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,"Family get away, need to relax, enjoy and shopping. But we dont experience to eat at your buffet. I heared that your buffet is best food ever in las vegas. Casino are good, your lazy river are good and my kids love it."
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,"Very happy with my stay in this hotel i highly recommend this place front desk staff very professional ,and I like it that I can used my phone to get in my room using the app my wife love it worth of money"
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,"Not what it used to be, Expected more for paying for a suite. Self Check in was a P. In the A eventually the desk personnel got me my keys and got us checked in. TV was almost useless as it lost authorization every 8 to 12 min. Casino was clean. Do not expect to enjoy your view the Graphics on the window ruin that. and Have to search for getting lights on in the room with areas remaining dark.  "
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,"MGM Grand is a Vegas classic, it’s worth staying at once. The staff is phenomenal and it makes up for where the actual rooms lack. This hotel does have great restaurant selections and fun gambling. I would stay here again if I got a good deal, but it probably would not be my first choice. "
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,Overall it was good the parking lot was very full all the time long walk about 10 minutes from parking lot to room lots of activities no heat no fridge no silverware hour wait for room service if any available at all
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,"I’ve been to Vegas several times and stayed at all MGM properties. On my honeymoon we stayed at MGM Grand and it was awful. I will not be back to that property!!! Dirty rooms, lack of staff to combat issues in the casino and hotel."
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,Was very surprised how clean and sanitary everything was. Great service good restaurants hope to see them all open back up very soon. Rooms where clean and provided face masks and hand sanitizer witch was very nice. I highly recommend the mgm I have stayed all over the strip and wanted to try mgm grand and was not disappointed!! 
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,The staff was extremely helpful and polite. Our room was clean and housekeeping always made sure it stayed that way. The absolutely go above and beyond to make sure your stay at the MGM is a pleasant one. I will definitely be visiting again. 😊
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,Easy experience. Free parking. Easy access to everything. Complementary masks and hand sanarizer. Rooms were clean and felt safe. All around enjoyable. Close to food & attractions. Even the non strip view we had was good since we could see the airport and plants taking off and landing. 
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,We decided to stay for a week with the whole family. Our room keys stopped working a few times which made us go back to the front desk to deactivate keys. The rooms smelled like marijuana and was advised that they couldn’t stop the smell and people smoking in the rooms. 
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,We will  definitely be back. It will be even better once this pandemic is over. I wish we could have seen some shows but we did enjoy not having to wait in lines and not being in crowds. MGM has so many things to do inside that you really don't need to leave to hotel.  
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,Fun can be had anywhere it's just easier at the MGM Grand loss Vegas Their first a birthday not mine but anyway had a great time little different experience lot less people but kinda nice to have run of the place feel more important now staff is more accommodating no wait on any games and the drinks are still free unlike California 
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,"The entrance was very nice the rooms were nice and comfortable clean spacious, the staff was pleasant, casinos was nice the restaurants were nice, you got free drinks if you were playing the slots or tables in the casino. Great stay."
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia, Very clean and everyone really helpful and professional. Access to everything very close and strip. Recommend you buy you own water bottle for your stay really expensive in the room and hotel and casino.
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,"We had a wonderful time at the MGM Grand! Check in was easy and our front desk person was very friendly and helpful, the whole process only took about 15-20 minutes. Room was sparkling clean and we had a nice view.   My opinion on several things that were mentioned in reviews that I read before booking:   - I was mostly interested in the pool. Because of Covid19, there is a limit to the number of people that are allowed in the pool complex. I decided to rent a chair for the days we were visiting. It solved the problem. Trust me, rent a chair - you don’t want to miss out on this wonderful pool area, and you can come and go as you like when you’ve rented a chair.   - The weed smell is prevalent, it’s Vegas and pot is legal. It wasn’t enough to bother us at all.   - It’s a big…"
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,"I’ve been coming to MGM grand for years, Great atmosphere with casino and options of things to do. My only gripe is that the casino smells like marijuana and the room that we checked into reeked of marijuana for about a day. Out of all the casinos we went into this was the one that smelled like pot constantly, Needless to say this is probably going to be my last time staying at MGM grand"
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,Stayed here because we got married in Vegas. Wasn't the best place to stay! Hotel is very busy; housekeeping didn't stop by without calling for service.  Located in a great place; would like better service.
Skyloft at MGM Grand,Expedia,Everything was amazing. Was very welcome love everything about it. Well definitely come back and worth it love the view and pool . The staff are very friendly and helpful great customer service well definitely come back 
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"Great hotel for travel for business or pleasure. Dont need to go else where they have it all there. From the amazing 3 pools, clubs in night life, night swims to an entire variety of brand name store to purchase from. "
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"We just returned from our 3 night trip celebrating my husband’s birthday. We have stayed at the Encore many times and just love the hotel and especially the rooms. I felt like they did a great job keeping things cleaned and sanitized, and most staff that we encountered were wonderfully helpful. The bed is super comfortable and the bathroom is large and nice. The concierge group is AMAZING! And Julia, the amenities person really helped us in celebrating my husband’s day.   The bad - We had a cocktail server at the Parasol Up bar that was just horrible with a bad attitude. My husband was having a drink there and I came to meet him, asked for a water and got a mean look and then she never came back. The really bad part that will make us not return - the NOISE!! There was nightclub…"
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,Worst hotel organization in the universe they first disabled elevator access control. And send people to steal in the room. Made it guest problem not utilizing safe box or cash cage.   Wynn management has yet to explain nor any   gesture They refused canceling my remaining stay when this happened and charged me to switch to different room.
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"So the hotel and rooms are beautiful. I knew that encore was perhaps the more secluded hotel versus the Wynn but it kind of felt dead. We ended up at the Wynn casino, restaurants and pools just to be around some people.  On the first day we accessed the pool no problem. On the second day of three, all pools at both properties are full and we weren’t texted for availability until 430.  The restaurants are all too notch. "
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"We stay there for 5 days and it was perfect from begging to end with great service from the staff, very clean rooms, great amenities featuring Alexa in the room that can do many things for you with out having to live the bed, nice pool and casino. For sure will be coming back!   "
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,It was our first time at Wynn or Encore and I’m glad we read the reviews that suggested staying at Encore for a more relaxed atmosphere and the larger room. It was a really nice stay and I would definitely stay here again. 
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"This hotel/casino property is so clean and pretty!  We stayed overnight for the first time with a comped room (and we are NOT high rollers so that was nice) and were booked into a Premier Double.  The gentleman who checked us in was so friendly, as are all of the staff at this resort.  In fact, when the room was ready and I went to pick up my key, he greeted me by name without even checking my information first.   Definitely made us feel welcome.   The room was beautiful, large and very clean.  The beds were so comfortable with plenty of extra pillows.  A nice surprise was that you can turn lights on and off, close and open drapes, turn the TV off and on and more with Alexa!!  There is a tablet on the nightstand where you can get all kinds of information and you can even choose…"
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,The hotel is excellent.  Enjoyed the king suite breakfast at Point Terrace were excellent. Charlie's was good for burgers but Lakeside is terrible.  You should avoid this restaurant .  The pool and the staff at the pool are excellent.  Casino gives you amny options and service good.  Need to bring back valet services.
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"Waited two and a half hours for this view. Not what I booked and I booked  Direct with them. Plenty of other options on the strip with way better views and service. So called 5 Star,     It's a 3 star hotel on it's best day. Will not be back......"
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"The Encore at the Wynn is looking great! It's so clean and sanitized I'm feeling very safe here. It looks like more people are coming back with these new safety measures put into place to protect it's guests, the staff has done an excellent job. Every guests temperature is taken before entering and everyone is responsibly wearing a mask. Just love this place!"
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"We went to Vegas for my birthday. We enjoyed our stay at Encore for 4D/3N. It’s just across the road from Palazzo. Encore and Wynn are connected to each other. Each have their own casinos. A few branded shops; LV, Chanel, Prada, Alexander McQueen etc on the ground floor of both hotels. We had a lovely and spacious suite with panoramic view. I had yummy cocktails at the swimming pool, Parasol Up and Lobby Bar. Breakfast at Terrace Point Cafe was great. Red8 served delicious Malaysian fried rice. Didn’t get chance to dine at Jardin. There are a few more dining options at the hotels too. Please do make a reservation prior to dining as they’re always busy. We did some gambling and had some luck $$$$. It’s really a lucky birthday trip for me. "
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,Wing Lei is an exceptional dining experience.  The rooms are roomy and well equipped with smart features. Very nice touch upon entering your room the lights automatically come up and the curtains open which is cool welcome.
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"Encore and Wynn have been my go-to choices for Vegas almost every time we visit Las Vegas, either to meet Family or for Business.  This past stay was not the same; the rooms were clean and fresh, but there were about 90% Kids in the hotel, screaming and laughing on top of their lungs.  Totally different crowd than what we are use to from before.   We believe that due to lower room prices, it has drawn a “different” crowd.   I would not blame the Hotel, obviously, they need business during Covid to survive.    Thanks for reading my post."
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,I always enjoy staying at Encore if staying there as a couple. The room has so many amenities such as Alexa and so very clean. They really take their professionalism seriously since all of the employees there as so friendly. Can't wait to go back.
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"Our 1st Anniversary at Encore at Wynn was amazing. Stayed on the 50th floor, ate at several restaurants and created some great memories. The stay was pretty pricey but worth it for our 1st Anniversary."
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,Would stay again for sure!  A great  getaway with great service and spectacular staff.  Food was good and all the precautions of safety was covered.   Staff was friendly and helpful.  Vents in room over bed was a little warm but was tolerable because everything else was excellent.  No real complaints....well worth it!
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,they should close it down asap  this was not a very pleasant experience at all  this is pretty obvious  that everyone go to vegas want to expereince all of it. but in this pandemic the whole experience was sad stressfull and frankly very bad
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"I have been here for three times at the Encore Tower Suits, and it is always amazing to be back.. The design, room, service, and amenities are exquisite. I love to be there and always enjoy my time at the Wynn.. Greatly managed company! "
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,It was a great hotel experience staff is amazing the room is amazing nothing really with the rooms or the hotel the only thing I wish was that they can make the minimum bets a little more reasonable because everything is 25 and up nothing below that 
Encore at Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,My wife and I had an amazing time at the Encore. Our room had a beautiful view of Las Vegas. Loved the Alexa controls of almost everything in the room.  The service at the Encore is top notch. We felt welcome everywhere. 
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,Visited the Wynn over Labor Day weekend. Nice room and hotel with view but my folio included several charges that were not mine. Did not receive the resort credit promised at booking. Pool closed early while it was still sunny out. Casino dealers are rude.
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"Too many add on costs.  Casino smelled like cigarette smoke. The room design was excellent but for the price as compared to other high-end hotels, it should be. The room service menu prices are over the top for what you get.  I"
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,I had a lot of fun in this trip.we stayed in Wyann myself and all our friends..our trip this time was really great and at the end of the trip we found out that this was the best trip to Las Vegas and this was because we stayed at Wyann
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"most  electronics in room broken ,  security does nothing to make sure masks are worn and stop dope smoking.  and the scooters by young adults who do not need them   place was very clean and elegant and most workers were very nice and pleasant except security when you complain about the dope and masks "
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"First time back since they opened. Hotel had a great deal, but we would have gone regardless, Certainly not as crowded as before COVID. Which was interesting. Pool was less crowded. Nice not to have to wear a mask while sitting in lounge chair Staff is great, rooms are fantastic. But...due to the low room rates, it seems to draw the “stimulus check” crowd. Basically, the Beverly Hillbillies and The Jeffersons Go to Vegas” The smell of marijuana was predominant on the hotel floor we were on, despite it being a non-smoking floor. Seemed like Snoppy Dog Dog and his entourage were on the floor. Called the manager to complain. Said all they could do is have housekeeping deodorize the hallway. The hotel was only at 30% capacity. We were there mid-week. Definitely being impacted by…"
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"Wynn is lavish, and ala carte.  Don't expect anything cheap or bargain deals, instead you pay premium prices for VERY nice accommodations (Wynn rooms are somewhat dated) and exceptional service in the casino and restaurants"
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"I checked in through kiosk, I was not asked whether smoking room or non-smoking room. Of course I never imagine my room as smoking room because I saw the term, if you smoke in the room you will be fined $350. However, I was able to smell strong cigarette/marijuana smell in my room. I went down twice to front desk, but they didn’t offer room change, just said “we will send people to investigate”, and nothing changed. (Beside, TV was also cracked, but they didn’t offer room change for it.) I barely slept because I have allergy to smoke. It was NIGHTMARE. Don’t go there if you are not smoker. "
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"Wynn was beautiful, spotless, safe and more crowded than I expected.  I did stay over the weekend. Table mins at Wynn were $25 most of the time as was the craps table.  Encore was quieter and generally had lower minimums.  Mask enforcement was strong, I was warned by a pit boss twice and a dealer because my mask was not up around my eyes. Reservations for the restaurants was a good thing, no waiting in lines."
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,Amazing Staff Very Courteous And Accommodating. Alexa Enabled Lights And Window Treatments Made Everything Simple. Bathroom Was Beautiful And Relaxing. With Separate Water Closet. And The View From My Room Was Superb 
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"I booked this hotel because it had good reviews base on customer service. I called prior to booking because my husband has broke his foot and we needed to make sure they had wheelchair once we arrived. They said yes one would be available. I called again the week of our trip and once again they said yes we will have a wheelchair and it was optional for him to rent a scooter if one was available. Once we arrive, we checked in and there was no wheelchair! We ask to speak to a manger about this because we were told twice one would be available! The manager (Aliesha) was very short and rude when speaking to us. She calmed she called around and none were available. She offer to call security to escort us to our room. We waited 30 minutes and no one came! My husband and stand on his…"
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,We had an unexpected family emergency and we had to travel to California during the Pandemic. The halfway point was Las Vegas and we stayed at the Wynn. It was the nicest room I have ever stayed in and I have traveled extensively. 
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"My trip to the Wynn was amazing and I loved every bit of it, besides the fact I lost 3k. The room was clean, amazing view, everyone was so hospitable ,and I had the best time of my life. 10/10 would recommend!!"
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,I stayed in a non smoking floor (38th)but I smell cigarette smoke and Marijuana smoke leaking out to the corridors. Even the ICE room stinks with cigarette smoke. The corridor and ICE room smells like an ash tray. The rules are not being enforced! I paid a lot of money on a 5 star hotel that smells like an ashtray.
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,Hotel staff very courteous and friendly. Panoramic strip view room fantastic.  Rooms spacious and clean. Alexa also in the room was a great surprise.  Casino floor very clean and employees reminded guests to wear masks whennot drinking or smoking. Food and pool also excellent. 
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"Stayed here with a promo to stay 3 nights and get the 3rd night for free. We had just come from 3 nights at The Bellagio and were eager to experience the luxury of a true 5 star hotel. Unfortunately, we didn't get it. As someone who has stayed here before and absolutely loved it, I could see and feel the difference since the departure of namesake, Steve Wynn.   Check In: Slow, despite it not being busy, but friendly rep who allowed us to check in early and accommodate our request for a strip facing room. Also, our friend stayed 2 nights and didn't know about the promotion and asked if they would honor it. They said no. Boooo! Overall 4 stars.  Room: Clean, crisp decor and an amazing view from the 57th floor. Automated drapes controlled by Alexa was a nice touch. The robe was…"
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,We had a good time and dog friendly having an adjoining room is very convenient for multiple families  The mixed drinks are good and the house wine good we stayed at Harrahs casino for 1 night and Wynn is so much better specially the room  
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"During this crazy time, it was a delight to stay at this wonderful resort-style casino.  Staff was friendly and accommodating, and we had a romantic, wonderful dining experience at Costa di Mare.  We felt like all the protocols were in place for the safety of their guests."
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"Great, modern, clean and top facilities, nice breakfast. Hard to imagine a better hotel. Amazing style and decorations everywhere. You may just not leave the hotel at all. Beautiful retaurants, pools and casino. Would definitely return."
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,"I'm so disappointed that I chose to stay at Wynn. So many reviews said it was safe and that masks were enforced. Not true. There isn't enough security to enforce the amount of people trying to get around wearing one, or wearing one correctly. Wish I had never come on this trip. Apparently, there's no place safe in Vegas, so if you want to stay well, stay home!"
Wynn Las Vegas,Expedia,I've been to the Wynn on three prior occasions. I have always loved the set up and customer service. On this occasion I used my AE Platinum points to get a Tower King Room. With Tower rooms you get a separate smaller entrance with your own registration. As soon as you walk in they have a thermal camera checking your temperature. Subtle but productive. I was upgraded to a Salon Suite room. Stunning room with the bathroom the size of most master bedrooms. Beautiful room.        The Spa was great again of course with some COVID restrictions. The locker room and other amenities like the steam and sauna were closed off. You basically showed up 5 minutes for the service and were let into the room where you disrobed for the service. The massages were great but I did miss all the other…
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"I was able to benefit off the First responder rate the Venetian offered. From the moment I booked the stay with their customer service rep, I could tell the Venetian difference. Checking in was a breeze even with COVID and social distancing. They have a well organized process and offer a sanitization pack in the rooms that keep you safe as you are out and about. The pool was always packed so getting there early is key because space is limited. I stayed in June and July 4th of 2020 and I really felt they took the precautions seriously but didn't compromise hospitality or a quality  experience.  The Venetian difference for me was the amazing amount of shops and restaurants of high quality at your finger tips.  We ate a ton! I would highly recommend that even without a discount…"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"No amenities in the room while the fitness center/spa area was closed early everyday. The room was nice, the restaurants wonderful, but there wasn't a wow factor.  I probably will try another hotel next time to see if there is a difference. "
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"This hotel has gone ""way above and beyond the call of duty"" during these unprecedented times. The staff here are excellent, a guest guide is available in every room, and the view is amazing from the higher floors. I would highly recommend being here again soon. I felt like a king while sleeping here. Grazie, ""Viva Las Vegas"", and go Knights! Until we meet again, Arrivederci."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"Awesome nights for me to stay in Vegas!! Luxurious beds, nice view for plane spotting, a place for me to catch up on work, and easy access to shops and restaurants IN the resort and on the Las Vegas Strip!!! Made me feel like I was in First Class. Way above and beyond the Call of Duty!! Great job!! Viva Las Vegas!!!!"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"I did a mobile check in for The Venetian hotel in Las Vegas on 10/2. I check my acct that evening and found out I had been charged $543.99 on my card. I called customer service, they said it was a hold in case I used my hotel room card at any of the bars. I was never told about this charge. They said I would have to go to the front desk to have it corrected. I went up to the front desk. One person said it was because I opened the fridge in the room, another said it’s a hold they put on my acct for damages. Then someone else said it should’ve only been a $100 charge in case of any damages. I asked to speak to a manager but of course no one had enough courtesy to come out to discuss. Instead they said they would waive the resort fee. Which wasn’t waived bc my cost was still the…"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"Beautiful and clean place! Expensive, but worth the price. Their suites are clean and amazing! Slots are okay. Best place to eat is in the shop food court. Also has a Fat Tuesday inside, which was nice!"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"The Venetian sportsbook recently turned into a Wm Hill and the people working there are very angry and hateful. Stay away, go to Ceasers instead. There is an older, heavyset Asian woman who is a manager there and she is a thief. She tried to steal money from me but when I called her boss, he made her give me my money back. There is much better experience elsewhere. STAY AWAY FROM VENETIAN SPORTSBOOK."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"Our dream was to one day visit Europe and above all to visit Venice, in the meantime we came to this charming hotel in Venice, beautiful bright room with a very nice bathroom and little gifts like a good shampoo, the staff was very welcoming, many activities on site"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"My husband and I visited Vegas 9/27-9/30 and weren't sure what to expect after reading so many mixed reviews. We go to Vegas 1 or 2 times per year and took advantage of the essential worker deal this time. We were offered a beautiful suite at an exceptional rate and are so glad we took the chance to go during the pandemic! Room was spacious, extremely clean and comfortable. All amenities were available despite what other reviewers mentioned (hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, and daily housekeeping service). Sun-Thurs the pool didn't require a wait list and we enjoyed it. Masks required at the pool unless physically in the pool or sitting on the edge and they do enforce it. Food & beverage service available at the pool. Make sure to go to the Palazzo side before 3pm if you want…"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,I LOVED THIS HOTEL but two things kept it from being a 5 STAR!  After a day of gambling went to lay down in one of two rooms I rented . Noticed feathers coming from the bed in mine. After awhile more and more were all over. The bedding had a tear. My wife was itching and sneezing from this. Called front desk. Room service came in middle of night to change bedding and clean up. Had to dust & vacuum the room. Took over a hour!   Front desk took off 45.00 resort fee which is a ridicules fee anyway! But that is it? Did not plan on this happen first night.   Could of offered us a better comp in my opinion for a 5 Star Hotel!  Plus handicap rooms have no ceiling lift to pick you up and take you to shower or tub from the bed like Wynn & ARIA have for disabled guest . My son is…
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,Room was very clean and elegant. Staff was friendly. Food was a little pricey but very good. I enjoyed my stay in this beautiful hotel. Shops were nice. Thanks for a wonderful time. I will come back again.
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"If you’re looking for some sunbathing- the Venetian pool is not for you.  Unless, that is, you’d like sun from possibly 2:30-4:30 only.  And count on the crowds in the pool because it is the only place you can go and enjoy a mask-free experience.   "
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"Whenever affordable we try to stay at the Venetian. Rooms are huge, very comfortable and luxurious. It is quiet and very clean. Bathrooms are equally large, with tub and separate shower and a TV. There is no fridge to use in the room . For an extra charge they can put one in. The mini fridge in the room is stocked and by removing an item you automatically get charged. Plenty of shops and restaurants, you never have to leave."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"In the time of Covid-19 safety was a primary issue. We enjoyed a beautiful room, responsive staff and more important, great attention to health safety. Thank you for a memorable anniversary trip in the middle of a pandemic. We loved our trip and will feel safe to return soon. "
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"This hotel is absolutely stunning! It is huge, and it has so many spots to enjoy inside of it. The rooms are beautiful, and they are a nice size. It was like staying in a small apartment, it was so comfortable. It is in a very convenient location on the strip, and this hotel is well taken care of. They have security all around the hotel, and no one can go up to the rooms without checking in and out through the security. A HUGE plus!! They have delicious restaurants, a mall,a pool, a spa, a casino, a bar,and many other things. I was able to enjoy my birthday weekend in Vegas and everyone that worked at this hotel gave great customer service!! We will definitely be staying here again in the future!"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"I stayed and played at the Venetian September 13 thru 16 2020. I just have to say I played 6 times in there deepstack tournament.  The level of cleaning after each person moved tables or got knocked out was fast and efficient.  The staff was top notch to the likes i have never seen before anywhere. They sanitized the chips ,the cards, and all the tables and chairs.    Thank you for making my stay there safe and hassle free. The whole staff were  Consummate  Professionals.      If you have any reservations about covid -19 you don't need to worry. This place will make you feel safe. The rooms are some of the best on the strip. I just wish that I could have gotten more than 2 hand pays.  Thank you to all the staff for a wonderful stay and I hope to see you very soon .     After not…"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"I stayed here for five nights while attending a conference here and had an enjoyable stay. I had room 32101 on the 32nd floor with a great view. The suite itself was extremely spacious and well appointed. I really could not fault anything with the room. Very much luxury and what Venetian promised. Lots of attractions within the hotel itself and within walking distance and tons of places to eat. Great point for taking the Deuce and SDX for getting around as well. I would definitely stay here again on a future stay in Las Vegas.   Just one point to note, IHG benefits are not guaranteed here. However I did manage to get a 4pm check out and 2000 points for the stay."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"FIRST, let me start by saying my husband and I are not new to staying at the Venetian or Palazzo; our first time with these pair of resorts was a stay at Palazzo 3 years ago, which we loved. Since then we have stayed at The Venetian/Palazzo several times, including this last stay, which was for our anniversary. And this last stay confirmed for us that we will not be returning to The Venetian. There were WAY too many issues for a 5-star resort that charges the kind of rates and fees that it does.   Check-in was smooth. The receptionist convinced us to upgrade to a grand king suite and since it was our anniversary we decided, why not pay the extra $135 per night. But although the suite was really large (and he was nice enough to get us on the 31st floor), the suite was pretty…"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"First time in Vegas so nothing to compare it to, but I had first class service the entire time.  Room was large and well appointed.  Not much of a view but that's not why I was there.  Big bathtub was a lifesaver after 3 days of hiking the National Parks. Only annoyance was not being able to sit in a bar to have a drink (I hear it's being lifted any day now).  I'll be back!"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Expedia,"We went to LV for my bday.We asked a room with a nice view for my birthday as a gift.That’s what we got(look at the picture).I’ve been in Vegas on list 30 times.This was the worst view from our window ever.I was reading about the smell of Marijuana.Yes!Do something about it,because it was so bad...everywhere around the Resort.Wi-fi is so slow in the room.The Resort is nice.The room was very nice and big.Sorry to say that,but most of the guests were so getto.(And that’s why they smoke POT all over the place).I’d never think this kind of guest at a ‘5(?)’starts Resort.Maybe raise back the price.😂honestly,I don’t think I ever want or will come back to this place.I just went to Vegas about 5 weeks ago and stayed at (.....).That was a much better experience.I also want to say thanks…"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"Stayed in June. 2 couples, three rooms. The good? Wrap around terrace is amazing. From there, everything was difficult. Understaffed bars with employees that appeared not to want to be there. Mostly unfriendly, poorly managed response to the demand causing long waits for basics. Covid appears to have affected the operational capability of the property (understaffed, unfriendly). Food areas exceptionally slow 30-45 minutes for tacos (understaffed). For the price, the hype on this property is completely wrong. We were expecting a luxury like experience and found nothing of the sort there. There are too many choices in Vegas at far better prices with better experiences to risk another stay here. As a Marriott branded property, the one is a complete disappointment. Additionally, my…"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,Cosmo has the day for the worse is very true as stated by the previous reviewer. We used to love Cosmo until this time. Shame it was also to celebrate our anniversary. The valet broke our Tesla charge port as he hastily tried to drive the car while it was still plugged in. He also used the emergency exit on our door and damaged our window. The staff were rude when we asked for directions to a restaurant. TRULY DISAPPOINTED.  
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"This was my 3rd stay here in 5 years. Loved it the first time (2015). Close to everything  and great restaurants. Second  visit in (2018) there was more shall we say more young and careless rude guests here. Our last visit in 2020 with COVID, the hotel is FULL of POT smokers. That extra money we paid for the balcony fountain view was useless secondary to POT being smoked all around us and the hallway was unbearable with POT smell. People were fighting in the halls and balconies,. It felt like I paid for the seediest hotel on the strip. Sorry Cosmo- but you’re earning a very sleazy reputation. Trump tower is my next hotel."
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"The Hotel is Okay, but not good enough to compare against Bellagio nor Venetian... keep that in mind while booking.  We had to wait 30 min + to check out because there were not enough personnel to assist. One of the hotel representatives named Ray gave us a nasty attitude just for asking for help since we were late for the flight.  Suggestion: if you are booking a Hotel 5 star you might think of something different. "
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,We recently went to Las Vegas for a quick get away. The hotel/casino was extremely clean and felt safe. EVERYONE had on a mask as it was required. Extra cleaning efforts were evident at all times.   An unfortunate event happen that required my husband to be hospitalized and stay behind for 4 days because I had to leave and was banned from ER due to COVID. The hotel was very kind to extend our stay one night and even delivered “room service” to the ER for my husband. It was so nice he was cared for since I had to leave. Thank you to the Cosmopolitan for their amazing hospitality. 
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"The Cosmopolitan is an upscale, medium-size Strip resort with a unique style.   I booked the Wraparound Terrace Suite (Newly Renovated) (mountain view) on Hotels.com. Check-in was more difficult than it needed to be. There were no signs indicating where the check-in area was. Employees gave unhelpful directions, there was no line system. It took about 20 minutes. My room was ready 3 hours before the official check-in time, which was nice, but they couldn't seem to bring my bags up. The front desk kept telling me it would take 15-20 more minutes and kept missing that ETA. After waiting an hour, I went down to get my bags myself.   They placed a $150/night authorization on my card for incidentals.   The suite was on the 59th floor, was large, well-decorated, and had great views.…"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"Location ,size of room and bathroom were great. This was a quick Vegas escape .We decided on the Cosmopolitan for the room and the restaurants.  Check in was quick and great. Got in our room and a quick tour we discovered a face towel on the bathroom floor next to a bunch of hair . Called housekeeping and they did come right away and took care of the problem. Supervisor called and apologized.  Room service was great food and service.   The problem started when we were getting ready for bed and discovered a dirty pillow case and bedding. Called housekeeping and were informed they will send someone. Waited 45-60 minutes ( giving them a chance - maybe due to COVID they have less personnel)no one showed up. Called again and again they said they will send someone. I had to call a…"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"The vibe of the Cosmo is what it’s all about. Modern, vibrant and quirky. But the scenery and restaurant scene is one of the best in the strip. The rooms are generous and have some of the best views on the strip. A who’s who of folks coming through and some eye turning action. I highly recommend after a dozen trips here. Make sure to stop at their many eateries and especially look for the secret hidden ones. "
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas was a spectacular hotel experience. The staff was friendly and effective, even whispering ways for me to add a night at a lower rate than she could directly offer me. The room was spectacular with a balcony overlooking the Bellagio Fountains. The bathroom was enormous, including a huge shower with a bench and a deep bathtub with jets. There were two pools on-site. One seemed to be more geared toward the party crowd, while the other tended to be more chill. Lots of small food vendors on-site. The one we tried was delicious. The hotel was convenient to shopping, sites, and a slew of great restaurants (fancy and budget). I would love to stay here again."
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,We had walked through this hotel a few years ago and fell in love with it! The decor is unlike any other Vegas casino- super boujee. We decided to end our road trip to Colorado from SoCal with 2 nights at the Cosmopolitan. Since it’s hotter than heck in Vegas in summer the rooms are super cheap. We upgraded to a balcony room with lounge on the 46th floor for $45 a night and were so glad we did. The views of the Bellagio fountain and the rest of the strip were unbelievable!!
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"This hotel is in the heart of the Strip, this is the best part of the hotel. We booked the Terrace Studio Room via Chase Ultimate Rewards for $120 / night which didn't include the annoying $45 Resort fee. We also enjoyed the special promotion which gave us $50 / person per stay to use it by the Pool for food and Drinks  Our Room was the highlight of the trip, we were in the Boulevard Tower on the 60th Floor with fantastic view of the trip and we saw the Bellagio and the fountains.   Pros:  1) Fantastic View on higher floors, Center Strip 2) Henry Restaurant and Scarpetta ( see me review separately, they are very good )  Cons:  1) Casino was smaller as compared to Bellagio  2) Crazy prices for mini bar  3) The shower head needs replacement, our booking said it 4) Pool was…"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"My twin brother and I stayed at the Cosmo for our 50th birthday. It’s a great property of course,  but the staff is what really made the difference. Housekeeping did a fantastic job every day; the front desk and bell/valet staff were also great. Everyone we came into contact with was friendly and helpful, as it should be. Very memorable stay, Thank You! "
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,My Boyfriend surprised me with 2 nights at the Cosmopolitan.  It was BEAUTIFUL!!   We also got a room with a balcony that over looked everything.  When checking in we were greeted by a WONDERFUL young lady  who made our check in quick and peaceful. 
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"The place made us feel unsafe. Really small Casino Floor with a lot of strip traffic, security dropped the ball and let people skate around without mask's. Lighting is Poor through the resort, making it feel like more of a night club. Water was jacked up and only pretty much gave SUPER  HOT water and no cold out of every faucet even the Toilet.   Also Children really shouldn't be brought here in my opinion."
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,I've stayed here multiple times throughout the years.  Most recent stay was a much needed Vegas Staycation on the Strip and the Cosmo was the right pick for us....  Check in:  The gorgeous lobby has 8 digital pillars and a large digital panel which make for high tech decor and is definitely a social media opportunity.  The digital art will rotate and it is amazing.  Our check in process was efficient as the well trained staff was professional and worked with a sense of urgency.  Rooms:  High quality contemporary furniture has been in every room I've stayed in at the Cosmo.  Bathrooms have been spotless and functionally decorated well.  Beds are always comfortable with high quality pillows and sheets that make you want to lay in them all day.  My overall rooms experience has…
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"We stayed here on a Wednesday and Thursday. First off, if you are a guest you are not charged for valet service. That's a big savings. We booked this room through hotwire for a ridiculously low price. Once we got to guest services, we got upgraded to a Terrace suite for $65 dollars more per night.   The room was nice. Lots of room. A widescreen TV in the living room, and two large couches. An iPad controlled all the lighting and room settings. Unfortunately, I could never figure out how to turn on/off a specific room's lighting.   The bedroom was nice, the view (room 4321 on 43rd floor) was facing the Bellagio fountains and the strip. The view was priceless. A widescreen TV was also in the bedroom. Not a fan of the bed. Both my husband and I woke up with sore backs. The bed…"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"Indeed this is truly a beautiful hotel with large spacious rooms with some offering a terrace. The best part is that the rooms offer an extra fridge for guests to use during their stay and unlike other hotels, it is free of charge and already in the room. I also enjoyed having a terrace where I could just unwind in the fresh air and enjoy the views on the comfy furnishings. The terrace rooms also offer nice thick terry cloth robes as well as slippers, which is always a plus. The hotel itself is situated in the heart of the strip and within walking distance to most casinos and restaurants. I loved the decorations, very classy and modern. The resort fee is comparable to most other hotels but the daily incidental fee of $150 is outrageous. So having said all of this the con is that…"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,"What a beautiful place, Is what I thought upon arriving .. classy eloquent and chic. But I never had a person in hospitality tell me their rules were circumstantial..   uncomfortable and black , I’m out"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,I can’t say enough great things about my stay at Cosmopolitan. Arrived at 7:00 pm and was greeted by a very friendly checkin assistant that directed me to the registration which was a breeze. They had cleaning protocols down to the smallest detail and it felt very safe from the start.  The room was spectacular with a Terrance studio overlooking the fountains. It was on a lower floor but I didn’t care. It was great. It was a great deal of $99 a night and waived resort fees.   Thank you Cosmo for a memorable stay! 
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Expedia,Stay away from this place the cosmo staff is miserable and rude to there guest and are more concerned about harassing there customers about a mask even when having a drink or a smoke.Not Welcoming at all
The Palazzo,Expedia,"I booked a night at the Palazzo and it was a great stay. Very clean rooms and modern. The had the upgraded room about 1300sf a lot of space and great views. One of the best hotels in Las Vegas strip. Like all the hotels, food, movies and services are very expensive. Because of the COVID-19 they had a package with wipes, masks and sanitizer in the room. This hotel Is doing a good job maintaining everything clean and sanitized. I was very happy with the stay. "
The Palazzo,Expedia,"Great place to stay, Great Food, Clean, Very Covid 19 Clean,Freindly. I'm not kidding cleaning staff everywhere. Made sure everyone the set foot in that place was Body Temperature known, and Masked. Did it all pools,Dinning,casino, place is so big great for in door walks.Me And My fiancee had a spectacular time. Thanks!"
The Palazzo,Expedia,"We stay at the Palazzo multiple times per year on average. We are very appreciative of the staff's professionalism and friendliness, and always feel welcome. The rooms are spacious and clean, featuring a step-down sitting area. The Palazzo casino is well-organized with high ceilings, and Grazie points add up fast. Dining options abound here. We always have a great time."
The Palazzo,Expedia,"The Venetian/Palazzo reign as the top resort. The resort continues to improve its amenities for guests.During the COVID 19, the management has attended to every possible detail to ensure the safety of guests. I was hesitant to go to Vegas during this pandemic, but when I arrived at the Venetian and saw the safety features throughout the hotel, I had peace of mind. There were attendants who constantly cleaned surfaces as well as staff to discreetly monitor safety policies. When I wen to other top tier casinos, I did not see this. "
The Palazzo,Expedia,"I booked a room for me and my kids since we have all been through so much through this whole COVID-19 Pandemic. Being an essential worker, we got a great deal. I live in Vegas and never stay on the strip. From the minute me and my kids arrived, it was amazing. Temperature stations all over, masks available and hand sanitizer everywhere. I was very impressed. Dax who checked me in was great. Booked for Venetian, but he gave us a better high room with great view at Palazzo instead. My girls were in complete awe. They loved it. Constantly saw things being wiped down (elevators, escalators, doors, pool area,  etc). I applaud  everyone for their efforts in keeping me and my kids safe. Proud to call myself a Las Vegan and highly recommend the Venetian & Palazzo."
The Palazzo,Expedia,"My wife and I decided to try the Palazzo for our ten year anniversary and we really enjoyed our stay!    A big thanks to Karen at the front desk who helped us find a room that would be perfect for our preferences.  She also did a great job of explaining the layout of the hotel, what restaurants were open, and answering any other questions we had.  Our room was fantastic and we appreciated how committed the housekeeping and casino staff were to cleaning during this COVID situation.  We really enjoyed most of the roulette and craps dealers we interacted with (most of them were witty, but patient and helpful if you had any questions).  Additionally, we loved the vibe of the casino floor.    When traveling to Vegas, I think it's important to understand what type of crowd each casino…"
The Palazzo,Expedia,"If you're tired of being in and need a few days to get some relief in spite of covid-19, This is the place. The Palazzo and the Venetian are serious about covid sanitation. Each entrance has digital temperature scanning. You don't even know you are being scanned. If your temperature is too high you don't get in, not even to your own room. They do give you a chance to cool down if it's high.  There are casino employees at every escalator, at every elevator, at every slot machine, in each bathroom, wiping and sanitizing each of these areas. Rest assured any area you touch has been wiped down and sprayed. If you touch the railings on the escalator, it gets sprayed. Even when you don't touch an area it gets wiped. After you leave a slot machine, it gets sprayed. Can't tell you about…"
The Palazzo,Expedia,"I read all of the email and website correspondence being sent out by the Venetian and Palazzo before planning my trip to Las Vegas about how they have adopted new Covid 19 safe practices but I did not see any social distancing going on in the casino, walkways, cashier cage lines, restrooms, bars, parking garage, pools or really anywhere except the handful of restaurants and in the elevators. No one was encouraging or enforcing face masks and none of the slot machines were turned off to make sure someone didnt sit directly next to you while playing. There were no partitions set up at the black jack tables or roulette tables. I walked across the bridge to the Wynn Hotel and Casino and they are doing a much better job creating a safer and more enjoyable environment. Machines were…"
The Palazzo,Expedia,"We came to stay at the Palazzo on a great offer and it didn’t disappoint. The rooms are clean and beautiful, the food selections are many and the casino was fun. The convenience of the shops are great too ! Would definitely do this again !"
The Palazzo,Expedia,"No big complaints, perfect stay. Super clean, tight security, great staff. Cleanest and most organized casino we found on the strip. Check in was fast, easy and accommodating  Rooms are even nicer than Venetian. High floors have better view but elevators get lines for high floors. NO coffee maker in room? Come on, I’m paying $40 a day resort fee. At least give me some “free” coffee & tea.  Staff was great, everyone was friendly which is a great thing during Covid. Many places the employees don’t seem to be wanting to work. Even housekeeping is friendly and does a great job.  Pool has limited chairs but with the multiple pools you can find a place to swim or relax in your own space. The pools are in the shade until about 12-1:00 so they are slow and good for kids in the morning. …"
The Palazzo,Expedia,"We celebrate Father's Day at the Palazzo. The rooms,service restaurants and shops were all fantastic.! It was great  to walk to the Venetian we really felt like we were in Venice! I highly recommend the Palazzo Hotel and Casino!"
The Palazzo,Expedia,Awesome! Simply the best place we have stayed at. Super clean and safe.  My wife and daughter suffer from anxiety and they both had a super great time! Staff was friendly and helpful. We had lots of fun and the food was delicious. Super nice place we highly recommend it.
The Palazzo,Expedia,"Stayed here in mid-June. We usually stay at the Wynn, but decided to try somewhere different. That was a mistake. There were no chairs to be found by any of the Palazzo or Venetian pools. Many screaming, splashing children. Fine- I totally get it. Don’t go in the pool if you don’t want to get wet. But, if you are looking forward to a quiet, relaxing day by the pool, this will not be for you. They will not deliver food poolside, so don’t plan on eating. There are several pools, but they are all pretty small and crowded. Pay the money and spring for a Wynn tower suite. We wished we did. "
The Palazzo,Expedia,"From the time we made our reservation with a third-party because we could not get a hold of the hotel for four nights in a row and their reservation line which no one was answering. We surely found out that hotel is terribly understaffed. Staff they have there seems to be inexperienced. I have stayed at this hotel we’re times than I can count. And I never had under a four-star stay. But this time the manager was a joke. End it was the ripple effect throughout the hotel you could tell the man that was running the place wasn’t running it. Yes we have a virus. But that doesn’t mean that you open a hotel with no restaurants, no shopping, as my wife put it a holiday in express without the cinnamon rolls The rooms were stripped out. We did not get our usual upgrade nor fruit basket or…"
The Palazzo,Expedia,"I gave you 2 stars only because I was disappointed at the last visit . I had a beautiful room Siena suite 5-910 I was just disappointed with the view of the concrete wall. I'm sure you understand that I was angry that I had to offer an upgrade view! I think it's weird to sell Siena suit + upgrade view and finally give the customer a view of the concrete wall . I was in hotel from 11/21 to 11/23 .  Everything was amazing, the hotel is beautiful, perfect SPA and world restaurants - I recommend  if you would like to somehow repair your reputation you have a chance to give me a good personal offer, I plan to visit Las Vegas and I hope Palazzo from 6/27. DM me martin.kyzur@gmail.com"
The Palazzo,Expedia,"The rooms are beautiful, good sized, and truly comfortable.  The property is gorgeous and there is so much to see that it's nice to just walk around the property.  The staff were all nice and accommodating.  There were a couple small things that we left from the previous guests that made us question if the room was cleaned properly but they came right up and fixed it.  Couple of tips....  1) Make sure to have your bags sent up when you check in.  After a long day of travel the bell hop took our bags - we went to the front desk to check in - then went up to our room.  We were there for a half our or so then decided to grab something to eat.  We were down stairs for a an hour or so then went back up stairs and still no bags.  After traveling all day and just wanting to get…"
The Palazzo,Expedia,"It has a plaza linked with the Venetian hotel, the plaza has an artificial indoor blue sky in the plaza, together with the Venetian style buildings and the canal, makes the whole environment very beautiful, I love that plaza, you can get a ride for the Gondola, there are both indoor and outdoor canal, but they are not connected to each other, so you either ride the Gondola indoor or outdoor, but of course you can try both if you pay the money again. There are musicians to perform in the central space of the plaza, you can dining there while enjoying the musicians performance. It also provided free parking, so you can tour adjacent places by parking the car there."
The Palazzo,Expedia,"We stayed here again in September and this time brought some friends to the hotel with us. Everything was great, as usual.  Comfy bed. We love the fact that all rooms are suites so my husband and I have room to chill in the attached living room. All rooms have a large spotless bathroom where getting ready to go out actually feels fun and glamorous. The casino is clean, not-smoky/seedy and just a nice place to spend time and money haha. Perfect huge pool area with lots of chairs. Not too clubby but still has a chic, fun vibe.  Best value on the Strip for sure and we love that the Palazzo has access to the whole Venetian complex with tons of restaurants, shows, activities. We will definitely stay here again!"
The Palazzo,Expedia,"I was just in Vegas for my bachelorette party two weekends ago with 12 girls. We had a pretty full weekend planned but obviously that did not happen due to all the closures from the coronavirus.  We had girls flying in from 4 different cities coast to coast and we spent thousands of dollars just to be confined to our hotel room. While I understand that the hotels took the necessary action to ensure the safety of the guests and employees, I do not think enough was done in time. I would have appreciated some sort of alert that this was happening so that I could have called off or postponed this trip. I find it hard to believe that the hotel did not know that closures were part of their plan a day or even hours before we arrived. Guest relations was a waste of time to deal with so…"
The Palazzo,Expedia,"Everything went great from check in to check out. Booked through a third party site so did have to pay the resort fees at check in, but was expecting this. We had a huge beautiful suite overlooking the Wynn golf course which was very nice. All staff we interacted with were polite and helpful. One suggestion would be to improve the signage as between here and the Venetian we got lost several times.  Also, we got approached every time we walked through the property from what I am assuming were sales people of some kind, kind of annoying."
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,The fountain view stay well room was fantastic. We did need to move the furniture for optimal viewing but well worth the effort. Room service delivered every night and the food was very good. The air purifier cleaned the casino smoke from our clothes every evening.
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,"Evony, Erica, Joe and Josh did an excellent job checking me in.  I made an error when booking my stay and they al went above and beyond to correct my error and they even extended my stay so I didn’t miss out on any time with them."
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,The accommodation where very nice the staff was super friendly and took care of everything. No worries with the COVID-19 going they made sure they had all the appropriate measures tanks to keep guest and staff healthy as possible. Very nice establishment. 
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,Staff was extremely rude wouldn’t recommend I am from California took a trip for a 21st bday and wouldnt go back.. considering bellagio is suppose to be nice. It was ghetto and not worth it. Not how ir use to be and I am from Vegas
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,We spent 3 nights here and had a nice relaxing time. Our room was 26062 and had a view of the Fountain out front. You don’t really need to leave the Resort because they have everything you need. Everything felt clean and someone was always wiping things down. We have been been coming to Vegas every October for many years and this Resort is my favorite. It’s centrally located for everything we like to do. Housekeeping DOES need to do a better job. We received a wash cloth that was not acceptable and should have been thrown away. We will be back next year!
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,The view of the fountains and the city lights were awesome. The crowds were down due to the virus and that was a plus for us since it was our first time. Loved it and planning our next trip already !!!
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,"We were looking to stay somewhere that enabled us to stay within the hotel and have plenty of amenities.  There are many things like the fountain, casino, etc but the rooms were outdated, had more of a classic feel which my mother would enjoy. I think next time we’ll definitely stay elsewhere"
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,The water show was amazing. Wonderful to watch!! The water was on cue with the music. It wasn't too crowded either. I would definitely watch again whenever I visit Vegas. My friends and I really enjoyed ourselves.
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,"Bellagio service is second to NONE! We stayed 5 nights and had an amazing experience. Somehow, we had a random room charge from the pool, but when we called, the lady on the phone instantly took care of it without issue. Highly recommend the penthouse suite (overlooking the fountains)!! "
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,"  The hotel was beautiful, but the AC didn't go below 65, the vending machines were  ridiculously overpriced, the TV was small, and there wasn't enough places to eat in the actual hotel. But it was still a nice vacation."
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,It was ok. I thought it would’ve been a lot more classier hotel with the reputation Bellagio has. The staff wasn’t very friendly and the room was very clean. There was hair all over the bathroom counter and the blanket on the bed was dirty. 
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,From the moment we stepped out of the car we were treated like a priority. The staff was with us every step of the way making check-in a breeze. Once they settled us into our room we were able to really appreciate the beautiful room and fantastic fountain views. We really don't want to stay anywhere else! 
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,"I booked the Bellagio & flight with Las Vegas.com. Yes, the price was inexpensive and received the lower-class experience. The Bellagio staff was laughing saying I received the COVID-19 prices. I said yes and received the COVID-19 experience as well. It's very unfortunate this was our first & last time at the Bellagio."
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,"Property is centrally located on the strip and is jaw dropping beautiful. Elevator noise is very loud in this room and service although provided is at a very minimum. It is nice change having less people about but the shows, restaurants and buffets are still mostly non existent."
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,Horrible that they really steal peoples money like that The attractions are the only thing keeping them open i'm sure. It was my solo birthday trip and much needed. To end like this I wish I would have stayed elsewhere.
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,"While our kids were attending school virtually we decided to take a family trip to Las Vegas for a couple days. My wife had a promotion for a couple free nights at the Bellagio. We booked through the hotel MGM resorts app which was really simple. On the day of arrival there were a couple of registration personnel a soon as we got off the parking elevators, each with their tablet. Roumel the gentlemen that helped completed check-in on the app and handed us our card keys in 10 minutes. Even with an early check-in. This experience was all very helpful."
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,I had a great time.  I have stayed there twice now.  I have enjoyed both of my visits.  very clean and friendly.  I plan on coming back to stay again when I get the opportunity.  the food was good although a bit pricy but thats ok its a high end hotel.
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,Most amazing hotel. Room is beautiful. Bed is comfortable! Staff is very friendly. Casino was clean. They make sure that everyone is wearing masks and that they are cleaning regularly. I will always stay here. 
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,The staff was amazingly friendly and showed incredible customer service the hotel itself is beautiful beyond beautiful How ever the slots are not lose and the waitresses on the slot's floor don't come around that often. I would definitely stay here again but I would probably play somewhere else on the strip.
The Bellagio Las Vegas,Expedia,"Great service, great food. From dinner at Prime to lunch at the pool the food was awesome. The fountain view rooms are spectacular. We never got tired of watching the fountain show day or night. Table game and slots were clean and the staff was friendly."
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"Awesome penthouse strip view. Had to come hone and buy a Toto bidet toilet. Lol.   Great view, service, room, and really everything about the hotel and casino.  Short lines for taxi, and the casino was busy but not so overcrowded you couldn’t find a table. I have been to Vegas every year since mid 2000’s and this is the best hotel. Expensive but worth it"
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"This was almost the worst visit.   The Staff is friendly but not helpful.   I was give the run around and had to drag a staff  to have the other verify what was promise to me.     Very pretty property that has the worst service, they blame the system is slow or down."
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"We've been staying with ARIA the last 3 years, a total of 8 trips, have never had a bad experience. Everything from room quality, food, staff and management is superb. The spa is of highest comfort and quality,  concierge services excellent management professional and tuned in to making your stay an experience never to forget. "
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"ARIA is exceptional Great service, cleanliness, best restaurant, night club, great location. I’m talking about high end of casino resort. The only things that I like to complain is there are nothing for family with kids"
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,We flew into Vegas late and were pleasantly surprised when they upgraded our Tower corner suite to a corner Sky Suite! Absolutely gorgeous decor and the beds were unbelievably comfortable. This hotel has a great location with a staff that's pleasant and efficient. We have been to Vegas 3 times and have stayed here every time! We love the ARIA!
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"Our penthouse was amazing. We had great views to the strip. Their service is above and beyond, they make you feel like a rockstar! Just the small details set them apart from the others. Amazing experience and beautiful hotel! Highly recommend! "
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"This was my first time visiting Vegas. I went with my husband for my 40th birthday and the service was excellent. We were in the Sky suites, the room was clean and we had an amazing view. I would visit again!  Highly recommended "
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"Sky Suite room was fantastic but in-room charges are just ridiculously high. e.g., $12 for a small bottle of ginger ale.  $50 for fitness classes even when you're already paying for daily resort fees.  Crazy, unacceptably high prices for items that should be included.  I would not recommend this hotel.  If you're paying $1700 per night for a room I don't think you should pay $25 for a bottle of water.  Disappointing."
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,Sky Suites are some of the most beautiful suites in the US with incredible amenities and fantastic service. The only real issue is if you like to have a dark room to sleep in or nap during the daytime. The drapes are very poorly designed and do not darken the room at all. This is a major issue for anyone who likes a dark room for sleep
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,We celebrated our one year anniversary at the ARIA sky suites. This was a beautiful room and she loved the bathroom tub shower and toilet bidet. Friendly staff clean room modern hotel experience. We will be coming back again. We recommend this hotel to everyone looking for a spectacular Vegas view and experience.
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"as usual, staying in the sky suites, a first class, second to none experience. the staff are exceptional, and from the moment I arrived to checking out, i was made to feel like royalty. looking forward to My next visit. Special acknowledgement to all the high limit room lounge. a bartender Andrew, and a server Sarah made my time there very welcoming and friendly."
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,Love this hotel on the Vegas strip! Fantastic view and a lovely hotel. We had a great trip and we could not have choose a better location. I will choose to stay at the ARIA hotel and casino again during my next visit.
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"My wife and I travel each year the a nice area, whether the Caymans New York etc... this was our first time to travel to Las Vegas during the holiday season. We love all aspects of our stay. The ARIA, we felt was one of our best experiences during a hectic time of the year. Rooms in the Sky Suites were outstanding and cleaned as well as maintained. Central to every where we wanted to go which is important to most folks.  Staff was friendly and you felt they enjoyed helping others. Loved it!1"
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,We decided to upgrade to the Sky Suites at the last moment and it ended up being a great choice.  The exclusive amenities along with the extremely accommodating staff helped make our stay memorable and fabulous.
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,Exceptional facilities and staff.   A great vacation spot.   Facilities were extraordinarily.   Staff was very professional and helpful. Everyone went way out of their way to ensure we had a great experience 
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"Another great stay at Sky Suites, awesome room, great housekeeping. Thanks for the special touches. Front desk staff great as always. We love coming here. Great ride from Brandon our driver from the hotel to the airport!"
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"We stayed in the Sky Suites previously.  It was amazing.  We decided to stay here for our 2 year wedding anniversary.  This stay did not live up to the luxury we have come to expect.  Upon walking in, there was a huge crack in the bathroom mirror.  Just aesthetic so we let it go.  Then the jacuzzi tub wouldn’t turn on.  The tub was a big selling point for us.  It took two conversations and a day and a half to get the tub fixed.  Now, our sheer curtains won’t open.  Staying on the 51st floor, I’d like to be able to enjoy the view.  Let’s see how long it takes them to solve this problem.  Our love for the sky suites has ended.  It’s just not worth it anymore."
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"I truly enjoyed my birthday stay at the ARIA in Las Vegas.  The service is excellent, the staff is very attentive, and my host is the best!  I like the ambiance of the hotel; it’s not too loud and busy, but it is clear that folks are having a great time."
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,"Lovely room, wonderful view, and staff make you feel not only welcomed but you feel their appreciation for choosing the Sky Suites for your stay. The bed is very comfortable, the bath linens are above the normal you find in suites. The rooms are nicely arranged for small party and still have your privacy. "
ARIA Sky Suites,Expedia,Excellent first experience at ARIA. Very quiet in the Sky Suite area. Highly recommend restaurants and in room dining was very good. We found all of the staff quite friendly and accommodating. Worth giving it a try!
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"Really enjoyed staying here, the room and service was extremely enjoyable. Every restaurant was on the high side of pricing but i’m sure the quality is why. I mostly went around the strip to eat where the food was more around my price range of like 15-20 dollars a plate. "
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"As magic as Las Vegas, you have everything inside the hotel, restaurants, casino, shopping, OMNIA, but on COVID season it’s a little sad to see very few people everywhere it’s also enjoyable because you will get the best pictures of everything without people. You need to use mask all time and in restaurants until you get your drinks."
Caesars Palace,Expedia,We arrived very late due to traffic and the line to check in was out the door. Kevin H. was able to check us in and still be cheery and personable. it was refreshing to have someone professional and attentive in spite of how many people he has been working with all night.   he gave us the feeling that we were his main priority and reassured we were taken care of.
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"Unless you are a high roller, do NOT stay here. I have had better customer service at a Super 8. I am not joking or exaggerating.  We booked a king smoking. One week after booking, all hotel rooms went non smoking.  No one called to tell us. It was the last place in Vegas allowing smoking rooms in all of Vegas. All because of Covid. Ok fine. But no social distancing in casinos and plenty of smoking there and at the pool. That does not seem logical to me?  Our room is dirty and has no coffee pot at all. They lied and said it was because of Covid. Three of our neighbors have them and at no charge. Every day we beg for more towels.  This all after over one hour wait at the only check in desk now. ((Due to Covid)). They claimed that the computers were “down”.  There is so much more,…"
Caesars Palace,Expedia,Five star rating over all on our two days stay. From the day we checked in until we checked out was a very great experience. We have decided we will definitely return for another stay in the near future. 
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"This is my new favorite hotel in Vegas.  It’s a hotel within a hotel on the top 3 floors of the Park MGM. The service is outstanding and personable. It was Super Bowl weekend and was super busy but no long lines at check in or check out at NoMad. The rooms are uniquely decorated, the beds are super comfy, very quiet and have great views!  Will definitely be staying here again. "
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"I had the scallops, they were excellent and the atmosphere is outstanding.  Decorated like a private library in a palace, this place is perfect for sophisticated night out.  We had to rush and the staff accommodated us so we could catch a show.  They even arranged for a cab to take us to our show, we made it on time!  Thanks NoMad!!"
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"NoMad is a quiet and upmarket option to stay in Las Vegas. The hotel is in the upper four floors of the Park MGM and the atmosphere is great, with low lights and nice, tasteful decor. Forget long lines for checking in or out. Here you get a more personalised experience and not the typical Las Vegas rush, as you have a different check in desk and lounge form Park MGM. The room was very comfortable with good amenities. I had a strip view which was also a nice touch to my stay in Vegas. Didn’t use the pool but you get a separate pool from Park MGM. Also a nice touch is the complimentary coffee in the hotel lobby every morning to kick start your day. NoMad is a recent addition to the Las Vegas hotel scene and it does make a difference. "
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,The bathroom was in the adjoining suite area and not where the shower is. Not something that we are used to but the rest of the room was fantastic. Pillows and the bed were very comfortable. My husband would have liked a desk rather than a small oval table.
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"We have stayed at almost every hotel in Las Vegas over the last forty years is this was a great find. From the greating at the front dest to the elegant lobby and room it was very welcoming. WHEN you visit, be sure to spend time at the Nomad Bar. I felt like royalty from the elegant surroundings and attentive service. We have stayed at the old Monte Carlo many times so we were a little skeptical as it had been run down towards the end. I am telling everyone about this place!! The beds were fantastic-and I sell bedding!"
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"My husband and I stayed at the NoMad for 5 nights in January.  I can’t say enough about how beautiful this hotel is. Our room was very large with 2 queen beds, a sitting area and a large bathroom. The floor was beautiful oak!! With 2 incredible area rugs that looked antique but weren’t. Blue velvet mini sofa, cute chairs and we each had the use of gorgeous robes and slippers. The only minor disappointment was there was no refrigerator (I know, I know). Staff were awesome and the look and feel overall was that of an exclusive, sexy, European look hotel."
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"The NoMad is perfect for those who want to add a little class to their Las Vegas holiday.  I arrived late on in the day, check in was a calm and efficient affair. I was shown to my room and given a tour by José, who I must say was an absolute credit to the NoMad resort. The welcome was warm and the tour was so important for me as a solo traveller. It made me all the more familiar and at ease with the facilities.   I had a room on the 30th floor with a beautiful strip view. The beds were so comfortable, all the amenities were excellent especially the softest bath robes I've experienced in Las Vegas. I would have liked another bathroom mirror along with what was there, one that magnifies your reflection for when I applied my makeup. That's the only thing I would add to the…"
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"Having stayed at the old Monte Carlo a couple of times, we were unsure about the remodel and rebranding to Park MGM and NoMad.  But not anymore.  The building has been beautifully reimagined.  NoMad features a separate lobby, which is beautiful.  There is also a separate entrance and a secluded hallway with which to access NoMad Restaurant and NoMad Bar.  We stayed in a NoMad king room, which was small but elegant.  The hardwood floor is a beautiful touch.  The decor was on point, the furnishings were in good shape, and the room just had a cozy feel.  The biggest drawback was a nearly total lack of storage.  The armoire features very limited hanging space, no usable drawers, and there is no closet in the room.  The bathroom is small but clean and attractive.  The biggest…"
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"Decided to give the new Nomad hotel a try at the top of the Park MGM. We had previously stayed in the Hotel 32 which is now the Nomad following the remodel of the old Monte Carlo. We received a great offer through the MLife program and decided to stay at that property for my 50th birthday. We arrived Friday afternoon and were happy to see a private's entrance for the hotel with its own valet. The valets and bellmen were very attentive and welcoming. The entrance and lobby area of the hotel are very dimly lit and the decor and furnishing are all darker colors, so the transition from bright sunlight to the dark was a bit shocking. The inside of the lobby area was really nice and akin to a boutique hotel. There were attendants waiting to escort you to the check in and answer any…"
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"We had a Grand Suite with a King bed room a separate sitting are and which was very nce. The decor was lovely. It had a large walk in shower and a nice vanity with a seat in the bathroom off of the bedroom. The toilet with another sink was in a separate bathroom entered from the living room. The suite had very good light from outside but also had heavy drapes we could clise at night. The mattress was very comfortable with great support but enough softness to not feel hard. Great pillows and linens.  We lived the hardwood floors with large oriental type rugs. The elevators servicing the NoMad floors of the Park MGM required your key card for elevator to stop at your floor. The dark hallways in the NoMad area were very relaxing when returning from the loud, bright main casino.…"
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,Had the best stay at NoMad. The hotel is gorgeous and luxe and everything is beautifully and tastefully decorated. The staff from the front desk to the bartenders were incredibly friendly and accommodating. Would love to stay here again. 
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"The Nomad is unique. Rooms were very clean, good sized. House keeping turn down service everynight is really nice to have. Great location on the strip. The tram to ARIA and Bellagio makes the rest of the strip very accessible. La La Noodle is an excellent choice for dinner as ours was exceptional. Will stay here again soon"
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,Last year I stayed at the Park MGM and they were just building the top 4 floors which constitututed the NoMad and additional restaurants.  I loved that fact that there was a claw tub in the room and from there I could jump in the shower in the bathroom.  The accommodations were wonderful.  Everyone treated me like an old friend.  I couldn't have asked for a better time.  I'll be back again real soon.
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"I used to go to Vegas yearly and have stayed in various hotels on the Strip, but the rooms all felt and looked roughly the same inside. Nomad was a welcome change and felt like a well-kept secret within the Park MGM complex (complete with its own side entrance.) It was perfectly central and allowed us to explore the whole Strip very conveniently.  For the actual room, we were upgraded to a Nomad Grand Suite to our surprise and our jaws dropped when we saw the place. It was so spacious, and artfully decorated. The in-room bathtub was such a luxurious touch! Wife appreciated the full vanity in the washroom. Our concierge Marissa did a wonderful job making our birthday trip special and arranging nightclub guest lists for us.   Loved the boutique feel and we felt very well taken…"
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,I found my new spot in Las Vegas I will highly recommended to check this place its amazing the rooms and decoration the atmosphere it’s really amazing it’s a great location great restaurants and casino all in one place 
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"Amazing hotel with super friendly staff. Tim is an absolute legend of a host! We came for New Year’s Eve and had a blast, there are lots of great bars and things to do all around the Nomad.  10/10 would recommend."
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,This is an excellent place to stay with the the family. Very friendly and helpful staff and a great location. You can walk to many properties and attractions on the strip. Have to say one of the best stays I had while in Vegas.
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"I used Fine Hotels and Resorts (amex platinum)to book this reservation. It was very affordable. 12pm check in, $100 food and beverage credit, breakfast daily for 2 and 4pm late checkout. This hotel is on the top 3 floors of the Park MGM and this place is absolutely stunning. They upgraded my room as pictured. Excellent service and a wonderful stay. The Park MGM is not massive like Mandalay Bay or MGM but its located in a great place on the strip. "
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,This place is a hidden gem! I would highly recommend it for any occasion. This was my second stay and will definitely not be my last. I have found a new home on the strip for my future Las Vegas trips.
NoMad Las Vegas,Expedia,"Very quiet... enjoyed the lack of hustle and bustle yet still in the middle of everything. Needs better and bigger bath amenities, iron and ironing board in room (not just a steamer). Also lobby coffee more frequently and served hot (was only lukewarm). "
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"If you’ve never ventured off the Strip...give Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa a try! I just wrapped up a 3 night stay at the Red Rock. This was my second time staying at the property (the first time was last year for the Super Bowl), and the team at Red Rock continues to exceed every expectation imaginable.   The hotel is a five star experience from start to finish. The rooms are very well appointed, the resort itself is immaculate and the amenities (VIP elevators; turn down service; concierge services) are top notch. They pay attention to the details and it translates to an amazing guest experience from start to finish.   My host, Steven Bernstein, and the team at Red Rock are the best in the business. Steven takes care of and anticipates every possible need...well before I even…"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"We booked a “Luxury Strip View” which by the way we don’t care about. We got to the room after a long day of travel and nothing worked. The Tv, half the lights, and on top of that the view was of a parking garage.  We called the desk and they would send someone which didn’t happen.  We then went to the front desk and asked for a manager which took a long time to appear.  He said “technically” the room was indeed a strip view it was just on a low floor. I asked if he would stand by that and he said he would. That is RIDICULOUS and is misleading as they charge more for that room type.  Tip to all hospitality managers - when you ask someone to pay for something and you give them something else and the bare minimum of the room does function and you are WRONG - make the customer…"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"I stayed here for 3 nights for a conference.  After leaving the room for dinner at 6pm one evening (everything normal), I returned at 10:15pm to a room that was completely consumed by the most revolting, nauseating raw sewage smell.  It turned out that some back-pressure must have drained the toilet p-trap of its water and all of the sewer lines of the entire hotel were wafting into my room.  Maintenance took 25 minutes to get to my room and was going to flush the lines, spray air freshener and set up a fan to blow the stink out into the hallway.  I told them I wanted a new room...to which they immediately obliged...but it took the bell captain another 30 minutes to come to my room with the new keys and get me transfer to the new suite.  So, I lost about 2 hours sleep, not to…"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,If you love Vegas and want to get away from all the lights and noise of the strip I highly recommend the Red Rock. I have stayed here numerous times and each time i enjoyed my stay very much. Rooms are very nice and spacious with great views of the mountains and the red rock canyon. Really love hanging out at the nice pool area and bar that they have. Casino itself is huge with many restaurants surrounding it. Buffet is very good and recommend going for breakfast. Look forward to staying again in the future.  
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"A beautiful location. Mountains in the background. The red doors are an awesome touch. Sign up free for their reward card and get a wonderful buffet for 12.99 Food was wonderful and a nice selection. A little ways out, bit well worth it. The most friendliest staff at the buffet"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"We went into the huge  restaurant and you are given two hours to eat as much as you can. You have a ton of selections be Chinese, Italian, Salad Bar, Sushi Bar  and so on. They also had a huge dessert section as well."
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,Everything was very nice and recently updated. The hallways are very long if attending a conference. It was nice to have several restaurants on the premises. I did not make it to the casino but walked through and not too smokey. A bit away from the strip as you can see in my photo.
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"I recently attended a Sales Meeting at the Red Rock Casino and stayed for four nights.  The rooms are nice and you have a choice of seeing the mountains or the Vegas Strip.  One of the pluses is that you are about 20 minutes from the Strip so you are away from some of the noise.  The hotel is well kept and very clean.  Be warned that the Casino and Resort are very large, so plan on doing A LOT of walking, even if  you never leave the hotel.  There are also a variety of restaurants to choose from including your typical all you can eat buffet option.  Overall a very good experience."
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"We were there for three nights. The men who checked us in wasn’t very friendly or welcoming. He also failed to mention our room going to be almost a 1/4 mile from any functioning elevator. And since we were on a low floor the view was of a parking structure. I think if we were on a higher floor closer to the elevator we would have been happier. But, the room itself was large and clean and the beds comfortable. There is an enormous bathtub which was fun, but the shower made a high pitch squeal which was not unique to our room as we could hear the squeal when others were taking a shower.   The pools were closed except for a two small ones and a hot tub - that were only open between 10-4. The kids enjoyed the bowling alley and movie theater and the food court made snacking easier.…"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"Staff were fantastic, really nice retreat away from the chaos of the strip with our children (aged 1 and 4).  We stayed in a 2 Bed Queen which was incredibly spacious even with a cot (crib) for our 1 year old.  Couldn't recommend this place more and it's literally a stones throw from the shops, bars and restaurants of Summerlin."
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"Red Rock Casino is pretty.  Hard to believe that they offer the guests nothing for staying there. No free daily breakfast.  I did not have a coffee pot, refrigerator or microwave in the room. Guess all that's extra. I found out after the fact.  I was charged $44.00 dollars a day by the hotel on top of what I had already paid in the first place. "
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"We had a very nice stay at Red Rock Casino in Las Vegas.  We received a comp room.  It was delightful to have a hand pay.  We also enjoyed a birthday dinner at T-Bones Chophouse.   Red Rock Casino also has a good movie theater,arcade, and bingo hall There are other restaurants as well as a a food court area.  Our room was very nice and I ike the large bathroom."
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,This hotel is far from all the noise of the strip and you get the best sleep and peace of mind. Great location and friendly staff not to mention the free valet parking. The pool is freat and the casino plays pays better than the hotels on the strip. I do not mind the 15 min drive from the strip. There is a mall nearby and the hotel offers a great and cheap buffet with all you can eat.
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"I very much enjoyed the stay at the Red Rock.  It was off the strip, but close enough if you wanted to go on the Strip you could. The Resort was very nice and included a Movie theater and Bowling ally. It has a wide variety of very good restaurants and even a food court.  The Red Rock also had a very good control over the cigarette smoke.  It as not over powering.  The scenario was beautiful."
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"Before I ever visited Las Vegas I had grand ideas about the city's Ocean Eleven's style of glamour and glitter. After having been to Las Vegas twice I know it's quite the opposite of that. I truly hated most of my time on the Strip. But my last stay at Red Rock Casino Resort made me soften up a bit again. That is, after I had finally managed to find the hotel entrance - and after doing a tour of the parking lot twice - they must put up better signs to signal hotel guests where to park!! The swanky surroundings and the lack of smoke and ringing bells (they don't force you to walk through the casino to enter the lifts) make for a much nicer welcome.   I had asked for a quiet room away from the elevator, and I sort of got that. My run of the house room was a deluxe king with city…"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"This hotel blew my expectations. The rooms are clean, luxurious and the bathroom was amazing. There was a very large bathtub and seperate shower. Beautiful marble countertops and flooring. The beds have tons of pillows and are comfortable. Beautiful view on either side. We stayed on the view that overlooked the strip which was awesome! You can also stay on the cannon view side. The staff was friendly. Lots of eating options and just a few minutes from the gorgeous Summerlin outdoor mall where there is so much to do. You can go ice skating in the winter! Will definately come back."
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"Stayed 5 nights for a conference held there.  What a great alternative to The Strip.  Beautiful property.  If you love the hustle and bustle of The Strip, this probably isn't for you. But if you want an upscale and relaxing experience, I highly recommend.  Every staff person I met was top notch.  Plenty of dining options, and at least when I was there, there were always plenty of lower stakes table games available...perfect for a novice gambler like me.  Tip: If walking is difficult for you, request a room near the elevator. These are the longest hallways I have ever seen and I stayed in the 3rd furthest room from the elevator..it was a hike!  Didn't bother me, but could be an issue if you have difficulty getting around.   Highly recommend for business or leisure."
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"Upon checking in, we were given a room that was recently remodeled. Little we knew our room was at the very end of a hall. Not what we expected. Now I know to request a room close to the elevator! Room was beautiful and very comfortable! I highly recommend this resort! "
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"I chose this resort for my husband’s birthday weekend primarily for its lovely pools and its location near the Red Rock Park. The hotel did not disappoint:  it was well designed with gracious rooms that had two person bathtubs, which we loved. The buffet was excellent with many healthy choices, and the hotel staff were warm, friendly and genuine. The problem was the pools:  the hotel decided to close all the pools except one tiny kiddie pool and a “warm tub,” despite charging a significant daily resort fee.  We complained to management who did refund our resort fee. So that helped; we bought a day pool pass at another place. Red Rock should keep their pools open the way all the other hotels do. If they did we would give it 5 stars. "
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,Expedia,"We spent one Saturday night here following a work conference on the Strip. We booked a King Canyon view room and stayed in room 14154. The view was amazing. Floor to ceiling windows that looked out at the Red Rocks Canyon was almost worth the price of admission itself, so to speak! The room was a long walk from the elevator as some others have mentioned but very nicely appointed and elegant. The hotel itself is such a nice contrast to being on the Strip and we were thrilled to look out our window at a gorgeous pool below with a fountain in the middle and very comfy lounges arranged all around it. We changed into our swimsuits excitedly and trekked back to the elevator to go down to the pool. When we got there we noted something disconcerting in the balmy mid 70's…"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"We stayed at this hotel for five nights.  The hotel itself is tucked behind the Bellagio, ARIA and Cosmopolitan resorts.  There is a very convenient bridge where you can walk from Vdara to Bellagio.  From Bellagio, you have easy access to the strip and to the tram which will take you to Park MGM and Excalibur.  It's also an easy walk to ARIA where you can access lots of restaurants, casino, etc.  The rooms at Vdara are fabulous, and the higher levels have great views no matter which side you're on.  We happened to have a view of the Bellagio fountains.  The rooms/suites are very nice with room darkening shades as well as light filtering shades, lots of space and great bathrooms with separate tub & shower.  The kitchen is well-equipped, but doesn't include any dishes, utensils,…"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"Need to pay attention to detail and cleanliness. My expectation of a penthouse is cleanliness and perfection as I would do in my own home. The view of the fountain was amazing. But, overall we made the best of the stay. "
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,Great location and smoke free hotel. Enjoyed view from room. Over all stay was good but my room should have been cleaned better and I was a late check-in. My room was $315.00 per night. For this price my room should have been cleaner. 
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"Amazing first stay at this hotel, it was very relaxing. Will come again! The concierge was very nice and the staff helped us know whether the rooms we wanted were available and how long it would take for them to get ready. "
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"Short Version: A ""mostly"" smoke free - mostly suite - hotel next to ARIA and Bellagio.  Been here 12+ times over the years and is my Go-To place ""on the Strip."" Yes, I would go back - recommend. Longer Version: I am a M Life Noir member, and a Hilton Lifetime Diamond so a very frequent traveler.  Even though the hotel is 10+ years old, it still retains a modern (and clean) feel.  This time I got upgraded to a Corner Suite which has a LOT of space to relax and unwind.  Even the Studios have about 50% more room than a standard hotel room.  I like that this hotel does NOT have a casino - you have to walk next door to the ARIA or Bellagio for that . Fitness and Spa are smaller but adequate.  Same can be said for the ""mini market"" - small but adequate.  There is a Starbucks which is…"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"It’s a place who’s calming down in Vegas. Nice room with kitchen but don’t have appliances nether coffee maker. Fitness center is good but so small. Great but not excepcional the hotel. Very clean and convenient.  Starbuck and other cafe on this place. Another issue, don’t have self parking, just vallet."
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,Beautiful property too short of a stay wound of preferred a little bit better service as we were staying in the Penthouse suite in the 56th floor at the top. We were hoping to have more of a vip experience on this trip. 
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"I booked a corner one bedroom suite with the intention of using the sofa bed in the sitting room. I had to call the front dest to ask that bedding be delivered to the room as there were no sheets, blankets, or pillows on the sofa bed.  Housekeeping arrived and set up the bed, but I quickly noticed that the bed was broken and unusable. I attempted to change rooms, but there was no availability. I booked a separate room in the ARIA for my daughter and her boyfriend, as the three of us in the one available bed in my unit wouldn't be an option. They enjoyed their stay at the ARIA, and I stayed in the Vdara with the cheap broken sofa bed. The bathroom was large and very nice, but there was NO hairdryer to be found anywhere. The kitchen was small and clean with a full size…"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,love the vadra i started staying there a couple of years ago i pretty much stay there every time i go to Las Vegas. My son recommended the Vdara to me. The only time i do not stay there is if  it is a last minute reservation and they sold out. Thank you Vdara  Annette Lamas 
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"Hotel beautiful and very quiet; convenient to small shops and miracle mall; room was beautiful, back view of Bellagio fountain. I had lounge access which I will not get next time, only visited lounge 3X during a 4 day stay. Staff was exceptional,was very helpful with getting me items I needed that I left home. "
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,Great Place /Great value in Vegas. We have been to Vegas a number of times and didn't know much about this hotel-- our first stya at Vdara will not be our last! The hotel  proved to be a diamond in the rough . Spacious rooms with a wonderful view of the Bellagio Fountain show. The staff was helpful and courteous. The concierge sservcie got us toip front row seats to a specila show we asked for. .. and the price was as good as anywhere on the strip with Top facilities. 
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,Always enjoy my stay. Hotel is in the middle of the strip with easy access to other hotels. Food was great. staff was friendly. The beds were very comfortable. Only wish the tub was big enough for two.
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,No casino makes this a quieter hotel. Also being on the more expensive side - this hotel doesn’t attract the super loud rowdy kids. But it is a bit expensive. 3 day stay with a couple of meals - $900.
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"First time staying at the Vdara. We arrived early and our room was available which was great. Check-in was fast and friendly.  We had a Studio Fountain View Room. The room was great. Lot's of space, large bathroom where both of us could get ready at the same time. The bed was very comfortable and lot's of bedside chargers.   The room was equipped with a mini fridge, microwave, kitchen table, sitting area, bedroom space and the bathroom had a good size walk in shower and a seperate soaker tub.    The view was perfect. You could see the mountains (hills) on one side and the strip with the fountain show out the windows as well.    There is some room for improvement in the cleaning of the rooms, there were some spots with a lot of dust and the couch arm had a large visible stain.  …"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"I love the fact that they don't have a Casino and I can breath fresh air! the rooms are spacious and beautiful, the views are gorgeous especially in the early morning.The rooms are exceptionally clean and I never once got disrupted by anyone around, either service or guests. Very well kept hotel, feels brand new and the cocktails at the bar are just what one needs when we arrive to the hotel!"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"The Vdara is a nice hotel and well located on the strip and the quality of the rooms and the views from the rooms were great.  However, Service at the hotel and the dining options were below expectations. "
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"I loved the hotel for its no smoking and no casino policy. It is clean and modern. Staff is very friendly. Several issues did disturb me. The pillows are huge and lumpy. My neck hurt after the first night. The hotel had NO other options, so I had to travel by taxi to a big box store to purchase a pillow so that I could sleep for the next two nights. There is no coffee maker in the room. I later found out that one could be provided for $20. Budget hotels all have coffeemakers. If guests pay extra (I did) they have access to the Club Lounge, which serves breakfast and Happy Hour. That was quite nice. Gourmet coffeemaker and soft drinks are there from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm. So..... if you bring your own pillow and coffeemaker or electric teakettle, it is perfect."
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"The staff at Vdara aims to please, the rooms are fantastic, and the location offers convenient to access the strip and other venues. The lack of a casino is NOT a detriment. The lobby is easier to navigate, the bar conversations are easier, and casino access is just a few steps away. "
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,Room are beautiful and clean. The view was great. Staff are friendly and helpful. The vdara is on the strip so you can easily just be walking the strip and shopping. The bar is nice and fancy. Only downsize is no parking but you can park at ARIA or cosmo 
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,Expedia,"Ok ,, expect a little more for the money .  Parking is an issue and you have to park a bit aways.  There are less places to eat in this place than other casino/hotels.  There is no casino within this location."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,Excellent rooms. Pool is nice and relaxing!! Also the spa was awesome. The hotel is a lot quieter than other resorts in Vegas. The large windows in the suites allow for a beautiful views  Especially at night. Great resort 
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"The Trump Hotel in Las Vegas is elegant. However, the hotel fell way short in several notable ways.  1) No pre-arrival email, which you typically get at a 5-star hotel. 2) The arrival experience is more like a Holiday Inn.  3) Similarly, the check-out experience was below standard. Never thanked for staying and never asked how my stay was. 4) Hotel restaurant is in a wing of the lobby and has no atmosphere at all. Lights are too bright and the lobby music was too loud and the wrong kind of music for the elegant lobby. 5) Guest rooms are starting to show their age. No USB outlets and not many electrical outlets. Instead you have a data port next to the bed.  6) The curtains and drapes do not effectively blackout the room. I expect electronic blackout blinds at a modern 5-star…"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"We have stayed at this Trump property before and is the reason why we chose it again for this trip. We love the hotel and the rooms but the restaurant wait time for lunch today was unacceptable. People who were seated after us were already leaving so after 15 minutes of zero server interaction, we decided to leave too. I let the manager know we were disappointed with the wait time."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,Stayed in most hotels in vegas & non doing it better than papa Trump. Thank you for the best service cleanliness location & the beautiful building itself that light up the whole surrounding streets around it to Gold color which i thought gave it a warm feeling.
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"This hotel was in the perfect location. The pool and the rooms were ample. A good thing that they don't have a casino onsite, the hotel was quiet and not crowded. It also sits directly across from a mall so you can walk to shopping. The view from our corner suite was great, specially at night. And we could get to the strip and the old Vegas easily. I would stay again at this hotel. Vegas was wonderful even under the stress and restrictions of the current events.The restaurants, casinos and entertainment were really loving us, the visitors. The food was great, the city was lively and well prepared for the safety and enjoyment of us tourists, in spite of the many shows' closures. "
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,Had a wonderful experience the whole time I was there. Everyone was friendly and all following guidelines. Definitely staying here again. My sons are 3 and 18 months old and they had a blast here. They didn't want to go home.
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,Rooms were very clean magnificent view the jacuzzi was awesome after long walks. On the strip. Staff was pleasant and very respectful. The pool on the outside was hot and in a sunny area. Was the only thing we did not like
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"I was looking for a nice room without the crowds. This place was perfect. I was treated like a VIP my entire stay. I absolutely love the bathroom. Big, spacious, & the bathtub is amazing. There was room to lounge and have drinks in the sitting area of the room. The bed was comfortable and easy to rest in. The pool was amazing! We went to the pool to cool down and the temperature was perfect. They had plenty of umbrellas for shade from the hot sun. It wasn't packed which made it perfect. The food at the restaurant was delicious. Drinks were kind of expensive, but it really doesn't matter too much when you're on vacation! The service was amazing too. The room service, the waiters at the pool, the lifeguards, the doormen... everyone was helpful and kind! We won't stay anywhere…"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"We traveled on a road trip that ended in Vegas with a stay at the Trump. We have stayed in many hotels since the Covid pandemic. The Trump provided the best service and experience. Everyone from valet, front desk, bell desk, security, pool food servicem restaurant and housekeeping provided the best service I have ever experienced before and during the pandemic. Everyone was helpful, polite, professional and respectful. Kelvin at the front desk was so nice and helpful. He is an excellent representative for the Trump organization. The bell desk promptly brought our bags. Valet uses text messages to retrieve cr which was very efficient. The Trump provided housekeeping, the only hotel to do so during pandemic, which made our stay so much more pleasant, beds made, trash removed,…"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"We stayed for 1 week at Trump Tower.  Upon arrival, we were checking out our 1-bedroom suite (room 4026) and pulled out the sofa bed where our son would be sleeping.  An empty marijuana container was found under the couch cushions along with an open water bottle.  We went down to the front desk to let them know what we had found.  We were offered a new room but unfortunately it would not be a Strip View room so we chose to keep the room we had.  They would send the cleaning staff back through immediately to guarantee the room was thoroughly cleaned AGAIN.  Later that evening, it was clear that it had not been cleaned again (or maybe even at all)  because we found USED dental flossers on our bedroom floor along with a few other small items that clearly proved that floor had not…"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"I’ve been here a couple of times over the years and it used to be decent. But recently it’s been a hot mess. The lobby was so dusty and I couldn’t stop sneezing, then the staff was just awful and unwelcoming. I think they need to rebrand this whole thing and just sell the building. It’s absolutely outdated and not in the cool vintage way, but in the nasty old run down way. It sticks out like a sore thumb and really doesn’t have much to offer. Would not recommend. "
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"This room is gorgeous big and decorated and also the corner suite.  I slept on the sofabed and is the most comfortable one I ever have. The bathroom is incredibly big and arranged.  We have jacuzi bath tube with big window next to it.  All we do just relax in this room and enjoyed he very tastful dinner and breakfest in the DJT restaurant in the lobby.  The staff cares a lot regarind the secruity, one time I didn't totaly closed the door and the staff come up to make sure we are OK.  This is very high end hotel and with current situation the rate become affordabel almost to everyone even this big room that we had.  Highly recommned for any purpose you visit Vegas.  Definiltey will come back to relax more !"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,great hotel with amazing service snd staff   will only stay Trump Las Vegas. The rooms are comfy and quiet and easy access to mall. Great spa experience along with fitness center and pool. DJT restaurant has a nice menu and delicious food
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"We loved our stay! They unit was beautiful and spacious, excellent location, friendly staff, excellent measures taken to ensure our safety. The kitchen was not fully equipped with pots and pans and we love cooking, but per our request, they sent us what we needed and enjoyed our stay very much! Now we are looking forward to returning soon!"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"A very fine hotel.  Great in room amenities, great guest service, great overall experience.  Extremely quick and free vallet parking! The valet parking was so fast they beat me out of the elevator every single time.  Also great location on the strip"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"I highly recommend this hotel and will definitely stay here again. Upon arrival my vehicle was valeted (without a charge). The staff was genuinely welcoming and helpful in answering my questions. Everything was clean and smelled fresh. One of the reasons I chose this hotel was for the non-smoking, non-casino environment. However, the strip is just a couple minute walk away. The room was clean and had amazing views of the strip and mountains. The bath towels and bedding were all clean, fresh and in great condition. We had a great night sleep. We had dinner at DJT as well as breakfast. The food was delicious and the staff was very accommodating. This is the best hotel experience I have ever had in Vegas and ranks in the top hotels I've stayed at overall!"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"It is a very nice place to stay, No casino no bs. Everything was great from stay to service. Not sure what else to state here, completely satisfied. Staff is great and willing to help and provide good service"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,Beautiful room & hotel. Clean and quiet which was a nice break from the Vegas Strip. We had a blast!  The employees were very friendly and helpful. The gift shop was awesome. Loved the diversity of the guests staying there. All around great visit!
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,"Although we were given a free upgrade to a suite - it was very dated. The service wasn't particularly good either and when we wanted to extend our stay by an extra night, they weren't very helpful which was bizarre. I wouldn't recommend staying here."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Expedia,This hotel was everything one needs for a luxurious stay in Las Vegas.  Rooms were large and clean!  The staff was helpful and courteous.  We had to walk to the strip but it is located right across the street from Nordstrom's.
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"Don't let the Henderson address deter you. This magnificent hotel is on Las Vegas Blvd. only a short distance from ""the strip"". It is 10 years old but the design and the layout are so contemporary and that you would think it just opened. It is super clean. The floorplans of the rooms are spacious and well thought out and the furnishings luxuriously contemporary. The bathrooms will wow you.The views whether mountain or city are pretty spectacular.  The main floor which houses most of the eating venues and the casino has lots of open space so you never feel crowded even at the slots. The ventilation is excellent.  The italian restaurant, the steak house, the buffet and the bakery/icecream parlor all get high marks.  Parking is complimentary unlike many strip hotels.  All in all…"
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"We came early on the recommendation of a friend. He claimed the food and price point made the buffet his favorite when he visits Las Vegas on business. For the most part he was correct. We sampled half of the dishes that Studio B provided for lunch and was not disappointed.  What stood out for me was the beef. I do not recall the cut but it was hot, moist and had the seasonings. My pieces were so tender I cut it with my fork. The turkey, ham and sausage were also a must try. What made the meat a cut above was the server. The large African American gentleman was the happiest person working there, which was a refreshing change even though he was overworked while patrons patiently waited their turn.  The dessert selection was not as large and plentiful as other buffets but what…"
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"My wife and I were celebrating our 15th anniversary by returning to Vegas where we were married.  This hotel is the cleanest and best smelling (yes, I said best smelling) of any hotel in Vegas.  The rooms are immaculate; modern, well spaced, and you can tell a lot of thought goes into the planning.  I almost don't want to give a good review so that this place doesn't get overrun by other travelers...because I want to go back soon!    The ventilation system is superb because (unlike the MGM) you could only smell fresh air throughout the facility...I was impressed!  Also, if you Google best buffet in Vegas, I'm sure this place ranks in the top 3.  We were so stuffed from the great food, we could barely get back to our room.    The hotel is is quiet and located off the strip, but…"
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"This facility is special. The views of the mountains, and the lights of Las Vegas. The staff is exceptional, attentive, courteous, Steak house great atmosphere buffet awesome adult brevages included in the price. This hotel has a shuttle Shuttle service. All the anemities expected at a top rated Resort. I love this place wow!!"
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"Well, technically it is still ""on"" the strip, just 10 miles further south.  Easily the friendliest staff, great rooms, excellent sports book room and way quieter than any other place. Classy and cool without being LOUD and obnoxious. "
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"everything was great. the people, the rooms, the gaming, the food. the only bone i have to pick was how slow the wifi was. it was totally useless. they charge for the wifi and i think i should get my money back. i have been to many hotels and this was the poorest excuse for wifi."
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"My spouse and I stayed overnight at the M Resort, the night before catching our flight back home the next day. We had visited the Valley of Fire state park that day and were coming off of our wedding weekend. The desk associate was friendly and check in was straightforward. She asked the nature of our visit so I mentioned that we had just got married this weekend. She told Us congratulations. The pleasant surprise was that the desk sent up a congratulations Card with a plate of chocolate covered strawberries for us!  The hotel itself was clean and decorated beautifully. We enjoyed both the jacuzzi tub as well as the enclosed shower. My husband thoroughly took advantage of the tv in the bathroom while he was shaving. Our view of the foothills outside the picture windows was…"
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,We really enjoyed the buffet at the M resort. Everything was fresh and good. A nice selection of beer and wine which is included with your food. There is a wide variety of foods to choose from including many vegetARIAn options. The desserts are simply amazing. So many delicious choices and served small enough that you can try several different ones. The coffee bar and gelato choice's are great. Take the time to eat here even if you are on the strip. It is a 20 minute uber ride but well worth it.
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"The M resort,spa and casino is a real jewel in the desert. The first stop off of I-15 coming from California is superior enough to stop driving to the ""Strip"". Inside the property you will find world class hotel rooms, pools, spa's, restaurants, shows, dinning choices and a spacious casino. All of the staff from housekeepers to exes are friendly, cheerful, knowledgeable, and willing to go the ""extra""mile to provide you with whatever you need. located near a golf course it has loads of available parking that are all free. It is located on Las Vegas Blvd. just 8 miles from the""Strip"" if you are that curious. They offer free shuttles to and from the airport and the Tropicana a ""sister"" property. They have a steak house on the 16th floor that offers breathtaking views of Las Vegas.…"
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"Kimberly at the front desk checked us in. She was very friendly and I had a question about a slot tournament. She got on the phone and made a couple calls to find out the information. She could have just said ...... "" I dont know "" BUT went out of her way to get the info.  Great customer service.  Room was wonderful. Nice and clean and bed was super. Restaurants were great. Also our casino host Brandon is a top notch guy and always there if we need anything. Only thing I would add ..... is I wish they would open up TWO Crap tables.  One seems to get way to busy and people cant play. Otherwise our #1 choice when in the Vegas area."
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,It was a really nice place with great options for food. I also thought the pool was great! I was surprised how inexpensive it was to upgrade to a suite. Oh also the Pit Boss's they had working there were very fair with there comps
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"Loved this hotel - good location at the other end of the strip, but not too too far away and there is a shuttle. Wonderful customer service from check in to check out and the entire hotel was very clean and well kept.  Loved the valet parking, the coffee shop and the restaurants.  Would definitely stay here again when in Vegas."
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,Wonderful place to stay away from the crowded strip and on the strip still. Its a hotel with grand luxury and great rooms. Restaurants are good the food was great. Just be prepared there food and shops are a bit pricey but other than that a great stay and good time. 
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"My wife and I stayed for a Saturday night over the Labor Day weekend.  We were delighted with the quality of the hotel - excellent fast check-in, no need to go through a casino to get to our large room, reasonably priced food for breakfast.  20-minute drive to get to the center of the Strip.  The only negative was the excessively noisy rap music at the pool, made worse by two competing sound systems playing different tracks - one at the extra-charge beach club, and the other blanketing the rest of the pool area.  There was literally nowhere to escape the cacophony.  (We are a couple in our late 60s.)"
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"We stayed at this resort for 3 days. Loved the little bakery Where we got our breakfast every Morning . really good croissants and red velvet cupcakes .We ate at the pasta bar, good service, good wines, Nice food. Did a day at the M pool, service was oke, But people Where smoking at the pool and there were Some plastic cups in it as well. Room was Nice and clean and had a Great view on the strip. For us the location was perfect. A 20 minute drive to the strip by car."
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"Great place for a getaway! Rooms are nice and quiet, and they're very comfortable. There's several restaurant's to choose from, like burgers, pizza, sushi, or you can get everything at their excellent buffet (A+ rating). There's even Top golf if you want something different, it's so much fun! Great place to stay!"
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"The M resort is by far our favorite place to stay. We go several times a year for the pool lounging and cocktails. We even got married there.....Its clean, its not packed and is resort like. We love this place"
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"We met a group of friends at the M resort last week for their early buffet dinner.  The casino is well organized and easy to walk around.  The buffet is great!  Well organized and offering many, many food and drink options, including beer and wine. I especially enjoyed their salad bar choices, all fresh and yummy!  They have a little bit of everything here, and you will not leave hungry!"
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"I really liked the M Hotel, but it’s not a safe hotel. Please lock your suitcase. They stole all my expensive makeup, my hair products. They stole even my daughters shoes, pens and pencil bag holder. I sent a message to the M hotel, no one even bother to reply. What a shame. Why would you still someone else’s makeup and belongings. So sad. We left to go out and eat and when we came back our stuff was missing... I’m sure it is one of the workers who else has access in our room"
M Resort Spa Casino Las Vegas,Expedia,"Stayed at the. M Resort Spa during early July.  I must say that the staff (and I mean the entire staff) were the most professional, polite group I’ve ever been around.  This includes the valets, maids, front desk staff, casino staff and wait staff in all restaurants.  It happened to be my birthday and when we had dinner my wife off handedly mentioned it and the waitress shows up with a carrot cake cupcake (it was fantastic!). When we got back to our room there were four chocolate covered strawberries in our room with a card from the front desk person.  I’m assuming she picked it up from my drivers license when we checked in.  However, every single person I interacted with were extremely positive and helpful.  We’ll definitely be back!!"
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,"My husband & I stayed here for 3 nights.  Room was great. Check in sucked because we were told we had a balance of $132 for resort fees that was not told to us when we booked package.   Also, 2 of the 3 nights the next room was playing loud music and generally partying.  Called front desk both nights (about 3am), not much done about it. "
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,Thank you for the great service.  Our family enjoyed our stay. The hotel room was very clean. There was no problems with the service. The restaurants are very nice. The activities are also nice. The shark reef was a very beautiful experience  
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,The whole experience was awesome. The room had the prefect view and the staff was amazing. The room was clean and was provided with mask to keep safe. Will book with them again. Bath was bomb as heck!
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,"At check in my room was dirty and after reporting, I was told cleaning is done on a schedule. It was cleaned the next day. I plan to visit Vegas again but will not be staying here. For the money that charged, I was expecting a better experience "
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,Had a great time at Mandalay Bay! The pool was great and the rooms were a deal. The wave pool and lazy river were open but the other pools were not. The main stay restaurants for almost all Strip locations are closed. There is still very good shopping locations north and south of the Strip.
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,"The best pool in Las Vegas is definitely at Mandalay Beach. I’ve stayed at almost every Las Vegas property and I’d have to say if you intend on being at the pool most of your stay, Mandalay Bay is the place to stay. "
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,"Had to park at Excalibur (1.5 miles away) because Jeep was too big for their garage.   Assured safe, our $800 bike was stolen.  Management handled the situation very rudely.  We were really looking forward to our 1st ever trip to Las Vegas was completely ruined and it could have been salvaged by the managements handling of the situation."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,Rooms was spacious. Covid precautions were good. All my family got masks and sanitizer in their rooms I didn't. No biggie cause I brought my own. Beds and pillow very comfy. Hug tub was nice.  Mobile check in wasn't as efficient as I had hoped it would be. 
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,This Hotel was the bomb  upon arrival the bell hoopers were nice and helpful my room check in time was appromately at 3pm but we arrived at the hotel  at 11am so they said the room would be ready in 25mins to check in so they notified us that our room was ready they handed us our room keys and we got on the elevator which  was very nice and shining then checked into our room which was nice and very clean .The bed was nice and comfortable and the bathroom  was marvelous as well I'd definitely  stay  back there again nextime. 
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,"Great time with the family, the stay was comforting and adventurous. The entire place was clean and everyone was wearing mask. Food and drinks were superb while the pool side experience was unforgettable!"
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,"It was decent. When I entered into the room, I had to request additional attention because my room was not properly cleaned. Initially they only offered a $50 food credit that expired once you checked out. "
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,"Minor maintenance issues, floors in rooms need more attention. Hotel overall is showing signs of wear and tear. Price point for rooms is not accurate for what you get. Beds are very soft which is uncomfortable in my opinion "
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,"I like the hotel I stayed there last year also, but this year they seemed to be price gauging you everywhere you turned from room service to sports book, to the restaurants. DO BETTER MGM!!  The only good thing was they offered free parking... "
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,Just below average right now.  Did not feel any staff went out of the way to make it a good experience.  They only great time was in the adult pool area when we rented two cabanas for Sunday.  This was the only part that was enjoyable.  
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,"There has been a bit of craziness in Vegas lately, however I've yet to experience anything of that nature staying at this property - and I've stayed at least once a month since June. Will be back again next month."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,"I broke the seal on the room and was expecting a very clean room only to find mildew in the airvents  and urine on the toilet seat. I notified management they promised to have it taken care of, when I returned there were garbage bags in my room. I asked them to come collect them, they moved them from the hallway onto the bathroom sink, I called over three times and they would never come get them. They told me to go buy dinner at one of the very few open restaurants and they would take care of it, and they didn’t. Very few places are open in this hotel, there were only two places to choose from for breakfast and neither were particularly appealing"
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,My first time staying at MB was well worth it. The front desk gentleman was very nice and professional. He accommodated my room when I was for a view of the new stadium. It is very clean and beautiful inside. 
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,Staff was very friendly and helpful. Your temperature is taken at registration. Everything was extremely clean and sanitized. There is also hand washing and hand sanitizing stations throughout the casino. I will definitely be staying here again. 
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,It was okay over all. Doubt id go back. Clean rooms no problem there. Gambling sucked. Lost 200 bucks in the first 30 mins. 1000 over all. I dont expect to win 1000’s but at least have fun playing. Bought a drink at the bar for 25 bucks and 4 beers cost 40. Pretty pricey. 
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Expedia,"Not a hotel I would recommend. Unfortunately, the customer service made the whole Experience really bad. I had nothing but issues since I checked in, I had to move two different times. Too bad because it’s a nice"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,I have stayed at this hotel the last 4-5 times I have been in Vegas and it it usually great. THis time was as far from great as you can get.  I had a regular room the forst night but I wanted to move due the next door guest.   The hotel gave me the option of upgrading to a sorner suite for $200 more a night. I took the offer because the last time I was able to get a room like this it was great.  The room I got this time was HORRIBLE. THe paint was peeling off the ceiling in the bathroom and the shower door handle was about to fall off. There was also no hooks to hang your towel in case you wanted to use it again.  THere was also a large busted and cracked electrical outlet cover in the middle of the floor that was so cracked I almost ripped a sock on it. The plate is right at…
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"So disappointed, not at all the Waldorf experience or quality.  With so many choices in Vegas I would not pick this hotel again.  The 2 room suite has no bathroom privacy.  The bar does not open until 4pm so if you arrive before your room is ready  you can not sit in the bar and have a drink while you wait.  You have to go to the restaurant where there is no atmosphere. "
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,Horrible accomadations the rooms here are to me not what ive seen at other waldorfs to be honest with you the room reminded me of maybe a hilton garden inn the decor and furniture was very cheap looking and carpet was dingy i have been a hilton honors member for a while now and this is the first time i have ever wrote a review but i just wanted to let yall know that not waldorf standards in my opinion
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"I've stayed here for the past couple years while traveling on business, solo.  As a woman this feels most comfortable, safe and convenient.  It gives me piece of mind that I will get rest to balance the chaos of the day.  "
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"I arrived on a Sunday from the East Coast at about 3:45 pm local time. My room wasn't ready until after 5 pm. The front desk person was not rude about it but was definitely not apologetic. I had to continuously check with them to find out the status of the room.  The hotel has no food or bar scene open during mid-day, so I had to leave the property to get a drink. It's almost 7 pm my time, and I'm in Vegas, so one would think they'd have something open.  The furniture is a little beat up. Its fabrics had lots of stains. The Do Not Disturb light didn't work, and there are no door signs you can hang."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"WA Las Vegas totally did not live up to the brand’s minimum standard in terms of service and hospitality. We did have an “unforgettable experience” as promised – unfortunately in a very bad way. Service attitude is terrible across the board. Hospitality? Nominal at best. Dining Experience? Snobbish and insolent staff at Zen Kitchen would readily and easily ruin your appetite. Spa treatment? That mediocre pedi&mani would require a redo in no time. In short, just stay away."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"Bottom line,look elsewhere if you want a true 5 star experience. Our Villa Suite had DIRTY dishes in kitchen from previous guests.It took TWO days to get clean! At $600+ a night ridiculous. Room was tired ."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,We had an amazing stay for 3 nights/4 days. The room was spacious and neat. The room had a huge bathroom and view was of the stripe. Hight light was the huge Bath tube.  The gym is small but totally upgraded and hardly busy so you can get a good workout in. The pool is cue. Since people actually have apartments in the building it was different. Cons: Not a lot for a Hilton Diamond Member. Requested an early check in but finally got a room at 5:45 PM. Walked in an someone was fixing the light. Also doesn't feel luxury when wires for the TV are exposed.  Overall a great hotel to stay at if you want to escape from the usual Vegas life.
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"Your have to go to the top floor to check in and then down to your room and the up and down each time you have to leave the hotel. Also, your need an instruction amanual to close the drapes and turn on the lights. Not what you would expect in an expensive hotel. Not good vaule and too much hassle for the money."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"We had a great stay.  2 nights, the room was clean.  The bathroom was the highlight of our trip.  Bathtub was awesome, so big and comfortable .  Staff was very accommodating and friendly.  The turn down service was a nice touch."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"I just had a long stay (13 nights) in Waldorf Astoria for Xmas and NYE. I upgraded the room to have a view on the strip. I paid all this without any voucher / credit / point. I would have expected some bonus/gift/anything but nothing.  The room was excellent, big, spacious and well furnished. The view was also beautiful despite I was only at 9th floor. I have been disappointed that the access to the spa was not free of charge for hotel guests but “only” 45$. The hotel does not have any casino or show, it’s really a quiet place to take a rest in Las Vegas. The staff had been kind and helped on various requests. I had an issue with the cleaning and they fixed it in very short time, afterwards they sent me couple of chocolates. Nice.  The only thing which bothered me has been the…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"I recently stayed at the Las Vegas Waldorf Astoria using my Free Weekend Night and a 2nd night was paid with cash using my $250 dollar resort credit.  I had a $100 dollar Hilton Gift Card which i planned to use during my stay.  The first night, I ate at the Zen Kitchen Restaurant and my bill came to be $153.41.  We had a hotel credit of $50 dollars ($25 per person per night) that we used.  So the total bill was $103.41.  The next morning, they charged my card $103.41 and i told them I had a $100 gift card.  They swiped the card for the $100 Gift card and then swiped my credit card for the remaining balance of $3.41.  Few days later, I looked at my statement and it shows $103.41 being charged.  The Hilton Statment dosen't show the gift card used as payment.  Called Hilton and no…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"First, the hotel is really compact in Las Vegas. Whenever you want to drive back to hotel, be careful to watch the entry. You may always miss the entry or drive into a wrong way. Second, the Hotel Lobby is on 23rd floor (Yes, it is not on the first floor). Be prepare, there is no a decent lobby. Do not expect to see what you paid for. Yes, it is really cost  to stay here. But the only make Waldorf Astoria stands out from other hotels is the price. Third, You have to change elevator whenever you want to go to your room because there is no elevator direct to the guess rooms.  Fourth, be careful about the invoice after checked out. If you do not receive an invoice, ask for it. Check invoice carefully, they may charge more than you should pay.  Fifth, no Casinos , no shopping mall,…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"Just checked out after a brief 1 night stay for New Year. Being a hotelier myself and having worked at some of the finest properties around the globe, my expectations of any WA property would naturally be very high.  WA Las Vegas property does not live up to the brand’s name & expectations, regretfully.  CONS:  - we checked in after 5pm and had activated the DND button sign electronically immediately after reaching the room. Close to 6pm, repetitive ringing on door bell happened. When we opened, a Lady from Housekeeping asked us do we want a turndown service. Seriously, ignoring the DND left us speechless. - stained and with holes bathrobe, makes you wonder who checks arrivals rooms and to what extent and detail. Photo attached. - dusty business desk lamp. Photo attached. - we…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"This is another one of those times when I had to spend a significant amount of time trying to decide between a 4 and 5 rating and I really wished we could do decimals or at least fractions...  Anyway, let's start with the bad news (the reasons it's not a straight up 5 star for me): because of the location, the orientation and the fact that the highest floors are condos, the views aren't great. They are not pet friendly. Even though check in was at 3pm, I had to wait until 5pm for my room to be ready, with no forewarning (the Hilton app is awesome but they did not leverage it to let me know the room wasn't going to be ready by 3pm; they also messed up the check in and check out process in the app -- the check in allowed me to choose a room that wasn't available and the app wasn't…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"Very comfortable hotel close to all the main attractions. We had a suite overlooking the strip and it was comfortable, clean and well appointed. Fabulous bar on the top floor. No casino in this hotel which is good as it makes a welcome break from this bustling and fun city. Breakfast was good. Will be back."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"I had a 4 night trip in Las Vegas for business and the Hotel was a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas while still very close to the ARIA, Cosmopolitan, and MGM Park.  The pool, Spa, and breakfast were all excellent.  "
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"High quality hotel. I really like e view of the sky bar. If you don’t want the smoke or casino stuff in your lobby, go to Waldorf Vegas. It’s a very high quality hotel and you can relax from the noises in Vegas."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,"We stayed at the Waldorf Astoria for three nights in December. I must say that I highly recommend this hotel to anyone. Its located in a good area on the strip. The hotel has no casino, which makes it quiet. I prefer that to an overcrowded hotel. With the hotel being in the center of the strip. It's just a short walk to the other hotels with casinos. The staff was very professional and were happy to help us with all of our needs."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Expedia,The lobby is on the 23rd floor. I had to take 2 separate elevators to make it to my room. Nothing special for my birthday. I was offered a better room for a small $250 fee. Paid a $45 resort fee for nothing. Paid $20.00 for 2 cups of coffee.
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,Staff was rude. Always had a smart comment when you questioned them about something. I didn’t realize they authorized additional money on the card for room damage and it was extensive. I was advised to read my paper next time and she slammed the phone down. Rude. Unimpressed. Below par.  Room wasn’t what I reserved. Self checked and still had to check in with a person because they screwed up. Somehow. Above a computer. 🙄
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,I was a bit worried considering it was on the end of the strip next to Mandalay Bay. However the location is perfect if you want to be on the strip but away from the crowds. The room was super nice being it was the size of a suite and the view i had was of the stadium which was wonderful at night. The only issue I had with the hotel were the limited eating choices.
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,"Delano was very refreshing and clean.  It is modern escape from typical ""vegas theme"".  I stayed for nearly 21 days for business.  The best part is the staff.  They are very kind.  Chey & Kimberlee the hotel managers were swift in follow-up to my request.  Seem like they do anything to help and hear concerns.  The lobby is beautiful and sheek. Plus the billing was transparent as I have had hotels try to sneak in ridiculous fees that weren't in the original bill.  Here are a couple other things you should know: the walk to self-park is about 10min so be aware and park near the yellow escalators to reduce walk time.  Room service is super steep. I paid $40 for a turkey sandwich. They have a $8.50 ""service fee"" on top of there already expensive dinner options.  But, hey I get. So…"
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,MGM Grand Delano is an outstanding property with great staff - - especially Steve Walker who oversees the meeting & convention operation.  Steve and his team care about every detail and their sense of urgency is remarkable
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,The staff was extremely helpful! They were clean and the beds were really comfortable. The staff at the pool made sure that we were safe by kindly providing mask. I would definitely recommend my friends and family to stay here again! 
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,"Room very clean, provided Covid 19 mask and sanitizer in room.  Was given a small suite, very comfortable bed.  Easy access to parking. Staff very helpful.  Close to shopping center and outlets not far.  Would definitely stay again."
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,"Nice hotel, quiet, big rooms,. Good drinks in the casino. Nice a Cafe for breakfast. A lot of very good restaurants. Super easy check in, good security and very helpful staff. Everything is super clean. The pool is amazing "
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,"My fiance and I's first time staying at the Delano, and we were thoroughly impressed. I have stayed previously at Luxor and MGM Grand, and was very satisfied with my stay. Even with Covid, there was plenty to see and do, and we never felt like there was something lacking with our trip. Would recommend and would love to come back."
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,Great stay at The Delano. Probably my favorite place to stay. Staff is always great.. rooms are exceptional and I do like the location. Never have to worry about too much traffic.  You have to remember to try a few of the restaurants!
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,"You want to enjoy your visit to Las Vegas and have a clean, safe and secure place to stay with the best staff???  Look no place else stay at the Delano. The location is prime and the hotel is spotless as well as the rooms are spacious.  A great family hotel."
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,"Pros: clean upscale boutique hotel. Spacious rooms plain pretty white clean.. tv in bathroom, shower and tub.. his her sinks. ""Beach"" is walking distance  Cons: not walking  distance to the strip. Need to drive or cab.  Vegas is hot and the large bottle Fiji water in the room was $22. Candy was $11 ..So hit up a store if you will have late night muchies or thirst.  "
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,"Absolutely wonderful stay.  Booked via Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts.  The front desk agent (cannot remember her name) was truly wonderful.  Upgraded to a corner unit room on the 34 floor overlooking the airport.  Room was well appointed, great views.  Would definitely recommend."
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,Had a wonderful stay. Corner room was gigantic & wonderful. View was Amazing of Mandalay Bay pool & Las Vegas Raiders Stadium. A great hotel without a casino but Mandalay Bay casino is just a few minutes walk away.
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,I was switch to two different room due to one having no hot water and the other one having mildew through out the living room floor. I flew out for a job interview and end up missing it because the room changing and the terrible service desk whine doesn’t answer their phones.
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,"We stayed in a suite - really enjoyed having a living area separate from the bedroom. Really liked having two separate water closets, double sinks in the bath area, and the tub was amazing. The beds were very comfortable, and I would love to know the brand of pillows supplied, they were also very comfortable. Everything felt high-end, making for a wonderful stay and a feeling of being well cared for. Adjoining rooms available."
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,View was amazing- hotel was clean - staff was awesome- worth every penny. Booked this hotel because previous reviews online. Room was very spacious- we stayed in the two bedroom loft - nite view was AMAZING. 
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,Stayed in one of he suites and was not impressed with the room. Found it to be very plane (all white paint) and furniture outdated. Probably would not stay here again.  I did like the electronic do not disturb system.  You could also push maid service to have the room cleaned.
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,"Outstanding service and location . Staff is very attentive and accommodating . Beach resort wasn't over crowded , and cabanas were reasonably priced . Amenities in cabanas worth the cost . Casinos clean and well spaced."
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,We reported to the front desk that our minibar fridge could not be opened & the tv didn't work. They sent a maintenance guy at 2:30 AM to fix these issues. I also had over $300 in minibar refreshment charges on my bill that I never used. However I did dispute the charges & most of them were removed from my bill.
Delano Las Vegas,Expedia,I was able to reserve a 36th floor room (suite-like) with the curved windows.  Great views!  The bedding and bathroom are terrific.  Please be aware there is only one drawer to store clothes.  Very long walk to the casino and super long walk to the pool.
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"Overall, our experience was beyond what I ever could have expected. My spouse and I needed to book a room early, as our flight itinerary changed last minute. Due to the change, we decided to book a room at a hotel where we had never stayed before in Las Vegas. After starting the booking process for Caesars Palace, I was offered the ability to upgrade our stay to the Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace. While I'm not one to upgrade normally, I was interested in what Nobu had to offer, so I booked a King Suite.   Upon arrival, I was a little turned around while in the Casino, and didn't quite know where to go. After a bit of walking, which was not a problem after sitting for a few hours on an airline, we found the nook where Nobu was. The hotel check-in, which is located directly…"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,Best suite in Las Vegas so far . Team was very helpful and knows hospitality . Keep up the great work . Food was amazing and nice gym facility . Didn’t have time to check out the spa but looks amazing as well. See you in the future 
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"Great boutique hotel in the Cesars Palace. I liked the location of the hotel within the hotel, easy access to the strip, casino, and restaurants. We only stayed for one night but definitely will be back. We got lucky and were able to check into our room early (around 10:30AM) and the ladies at the front desk were more than helpful! They answered all of my annoying tourist questions without hesitation! The room was comfortable, the shower was awesome, and i love hotels with a makeup area so that was a nice touch! My only complaint would be our room did not have a view and looked at the side of another building but could see part of the Paris tower so was ok."
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"Overall experience was average. Room was clean and quiet (walls are a little thin - so we could occasionally hear our neighbors). In room dining service was great - always timely and friendly. Also appreciated the direct text requests/messages to the concierge/front-desk - it made communication super easy and convenient.   Our main concern was when waiting for elevators, overhearing the front-desk chatting about a customer they just checked-in.  The two people working the desk proceeded to look up the guest' address to see where she lived and how much her home cost - they then debated the exclusivity of the neighborhood in LA.  Their final determination was ""she's definitely not rich"".  Besides being a complete privacy violation - it really shows that this hotel is NOT inclusive…"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"After reading several negative reviews about the Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace I was questioning my reservation and almost cancelled my stay to rebook at Planet Hollywood.  Unfortunately I was beyond the 72 hour free cancelation limit and needed to keep my original reservation at Nobu.   When I arrived on Sunday January 26th, 2020, I attempted to check in early around 1pm; however understood that the scheduled check in time was 4pm, so I was not too surprised that the Deluxe King room was not ready.  I checked my bags with the Bellman and decided to get a few drinks in the area and walk the strip to kill time.  At around 3pm I decided to press my luck to see if my room was ready as I had a photoshoot scheduled for 4pm.  The room I reserved was still not ready, but the host at the…"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"I have stayed in every tower in Caesars, but this was one of the best rooms I have stayed in to date.  Since it has its own separate check-in area, checking in was a breeze.  No line whatsoever and you go straight up the elevator from check-in right to your room instead of having to walk a mile to a tower to get to your room.  I got upgraded to a suite b/c it was my birthday, and the suite was incredible.  They also put a complimentary champagne bottle in my room for my birthday.  I really liked the complimentary cocktail hour for Nobu Hotel guests, plus the private gym was awesome.  Overall, one of the best Vegas stays I have had."
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"This was my second time staying at Nobu Hotel at Caesars. I had previously stayed for my birthday and we had an amazing time. This time I was staying for business. I checked in with Zoey, who remembered me from prior travel and was so welcoming after a long week of flying and meetings. She provided excellent service and was available for anything I needed. She made sure I had a great time and catered to anything I needed personalized during my stay. I had an amazing room and used the gym as well. Everything was given so much detail. I really enjoyed the tea in room and also the luxury bathroom and bath products. The room was absolutely spectacular, and because of her great customer service, I will definitely be back again! Thank you Zoey!"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"We usually stay at a resort off the strip, because I don’t like the noise at the Casinos.  We chose this hotel for our milestone anniversary, because it is a small boutique type hotel inside the Caesars Complex.  We were happy with the choice because I had a few health issues to flare up and everything was convenient in the Complex.  The staff is very friendly and professional.  We felt secure, because you have to use your key to use the elevators and someone was at the desk at all times.  The rooms are clean, comfortable and good for sleeping or relaxing.  The housekeepers quietly do their jobs without disturbing you.  Our View was basically of another tower and a bit of another Casino. Room service from Nobu Restaurant was delicious for breakfast and a late dinner.  I loved…"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"Our work takes us all around the world and we have stayed in some very nice hotels along the way. The Nabu ranks in the top five. The minute you walk in the room your pulse goes down. It is calming, peaceful and quiet. There is no smell of cigarette or cigar smoke, the bed feels like a cloud and it is tastefully appointed in a zen style - a delightful reprieve from the hustle and bustle in the casinos."
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"We came to Vegas just to see Van Morrison to celebrate our 15th anniversary.  It was the last place on earth we would have picked!  However we stayed at Nobu and from the moment we arrived, having passed through the fray of slot machines and cigarette smoke, we were greeted by Kennedy and assured that Nobu would be quiet.  To our surprise we were upgraded to the most beautiful room.  The food at Nobu was delicious.  Van Morrison was legendary in the classic Colosseum.  If anyone has to come to Vegas, and is not here to gamble, we highly recommend Nobu!!  Great service, beautiful rooms, tasteful, quiet, wonderful amenities.  Thank you Nobu team!!"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"We liked everything about Nobu, but especially the service. The rooms are spacious, quiet and modern. The bathrooms are great. And Nobu is right in the middle of Caesars...which is in the middle of everything. "
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,We stayed at NOBU for the first time and really enjoyed our stay. The rooms were very clean and the staff was very friendly.  I really don’t have any complaints because we were not there much but the overall experience was great with the staff. 
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"We’ve stayed at many of the Vegas hotels in the past and other towers at Caesars palace as well. I was surprised to receive a complimentary night at Nobu so we decided to check it out.  The rooms are nice and decorated very differently than others we have stayed in. We enjoyed the change. The bed was soft but still very comfortable and we had a great nights sleep.  Interesting bathroom but not much counter space. Most rooms we have stayed in have 2 smaller sinks with lots of counter space for our things. Sink was very deep and large and a bit overwhelming for the size of the bathroom. Some very nice touches I haven’t seen for awhile with robes, slippers, vanity kit etc.  While we were out for the evening, housekeeping had replaced some of our used toiletries and left water and…"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"We chose the Nobu boutique hotel for our girls weekend because of the location (within Caesars), the advertised ""VIP Concierge"" and size of the rooms. To say Nobu Hotel is underwhelming and over priced would be an understatement.    The hotel has a definite japanese, upscale vibe which is nice after walking through the Caesars casino that you will have a space to unwind. The concierge desk is small and can really only see 2 people (if you squeeze) at a time. So be prepared to wait. When we arrived (4:30 pm), one room was ready and one wasn't. We were told we would receive a phone call that the other room was ready at check-in, which was hectic being in such a small area. At 6:30 we still hadn't received a call, we went down to the concierge to check. The area was still busy, so…"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,We were treated great by Zoey and the entire Nobu staff!  I highly recommend Nobu when staying in Vegas.  The rooms are very nice and the hotel tower is located very conveniently in the center of the Caesars property near restaurants and shops.
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,Zoey at Nobu Hotel provides the best check-in experience. I received upgrades to both rooms without hesitation and a promotion on the awesome Hakone suite for four nights. She is the hardest working receptionist I have seen after multiple visits to Vegas. She is awesome. 
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"Believe the hype.  Super fresh nigiri.  Amazing service.  Shout out to front desk hostess Kaylee who quickly handled a reservation issue (open table was having issues that night) and got us seated in minutes despite being sold out.  We had booked months in advance and Nobu was to be the highlight of our anniversary trip.  The food reviews are on point, but little has been said about the incredible sake and Japanese whiskey menus.  I'm not a big drinker, but the flights looked like an interesting way to try 4 differnt typeof premium sake for the price of one glass. Super daiginjo best tasting stuff ever, paired perfectly with our nigiri.  Everything we tasted was fresh and well prepared.  This was a truly special experience for us!"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"paid for a 3 bedroom Sake suite....gave us 3 pods for our coffee in our room for a 5 night stay, if we wanted more it was $10 a pod, for the all 5 days!!!! 3 cups of coffee for 5 days in a 3 bedroom suite...we usually stay at the Bellagio, unlimited.. i was shocked 5 nights and 3 pods for the coffee machine for a 3 bedroom suite for the entire stay? i called ""concierge"" to make dining reservations at a ceasars top dollar restaurant she told me i had to call myself she could not do it...?? we asked for a newspaper they told us to go buy one....?? worst worst las vegas stay ever as far as customer service..... even housekeeping was awful...would not stay there ever again or recommend this to anyone..."
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"Once again stayed at the Nobu Hotel inside Caesars Palace. Staff greeted with smiles and by name every day.     Management at Nobu is excellent .....I wish I could say that about the rest at Caesars..,...they seem to have a disconnect which isn’t fair to Nobu."
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,Expedia,"The Nobu is a very Japanese style hotel.  Their location in the middle of Caesar's and the Forum Shops is excellent.  The service is good - perhaps a little TOO MUCH.  There was no privacy sign available on my door and they were ""in and out"" several times - much to both my surprise and dismay.  Unnecessary.  While the beds were comfy and the bathroom lovely?  They totally FAIL at lighting - for you cannot read a book with their very poor nightstand lighting.  When you use their lovely full length mirror in the room itself?  You cannot see a bloomin thing due to NO lighting and room lighting simply inadequate.  I'd also like to know WHO puts a SCALE in a vacation hotel bathroom? (lol)  I felt for the $197 per nite rate PLUS the ""small, fine printed"" resort fee of $51.02?  Making…"
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"The pool area of this very large hotel is fabulous, the food was great and the rooms were large and very comfortable had a very enjoyable stay"
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"We stayed the weekend and had a pleasant stay.  Checkin process was very easy with self check in and the option of early check in, before 4:00pm, for an additional $30.    Room was very spacious, clean and comfortable.    Casino is nice as well as the shopping and restaurants.    We booked our reservation here because we were scheduled to see two shoes that were both at Caesars.  We would stay again. "
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"A very classy casino with a great selection of restaurants and clubs. Every form of gaming you can think of is here. BUT, it is so big that it can take you 25 minutes to walk to your room. And the gorgeous pool area is very crowded.  If you like walking, this is great. But, if not, a smaller casino will suit you better."
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"My husband and I stayed here in February 2016 for four nights. We booked a standard room and it was the perfect size. They will try to convince you to upgrade, DON'T DO IT! The standard room is large, comfortable and clean as is the bathroom. They will allow you to request early check-in but aren't very accommodating for those with early flights. We arrived around 12:00pm and they said that while our room was available, it would be an additional charge for us to check in that early. No thank you! We handed our luggage over to concierge to store until we were allowed to check in early at 2:00pm.   The hotel is in a perfect location. The grounds are stunning and the design is absolutely incredible. Other hotels on the strip will be less expensive but you truly get what you pay for…"
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"Got an upgraded room in Octavious tower. This hotel has everything you need, great shops, restaraunts and pool area. Booked flight and hotel through BA great price. Must have the buffet breakfast at least once for $30 per person a bargain."
Caesars Palace,Expedia,Have someone with more experience at check in to accommodate someone checking multiple rooms and give proper guidance. Our room was fine but too far from our business which was incorrectly stated at check in.
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"I really like this hotel, It's in the middle of everything and it has everything you can possible want or do in one place. The restaurants are great. The pool area is clean and private. The guest aren't wild. The shopping is plentiful. I stayed in the Palace Tower. It had one of the biggest bath tubs with multi jets that I have ever seen in a hotel room. The room was great. Only negative was no view out the window but I only spent my time in the room for bathing & sleep so the view really didn't matter to me. I would highly recommend this hotel."
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"Amazing staff that makes sure you are catered to every need. Friendly, willing to go the extra mile. What more can you ask for? I highly recommend this place and make sure you eat here since they have the best buffet in Las Vegas and offer the top shows/concerts!"
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"I stayed in Octavious tower in a king room. The room was nice and still dazzled from the recent reno, but lacking in some common ammenities like a fridge and microwave. They can send a fridge up to your room for $20 night. Mini bar is annoying. Every time you remove anything it automatically charges your room. Pool closes at 7pm. Check-in is available thru the front desk or a check-in kiosk. Walls are thin and you will get woken in middle of night by rowdy neighbors. Beds are super comfortable. Bathroom is nicely laid out.  The customer service here is the most abhorrent and makes you feel like cattle in a huge cog (or CAFO). I would never stay here again for that reason alone. Take a look at the consistent attitude in reviews' hotel responses no matter how egregious someone's…"
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"I just came back from Vegas. Flew there from Boston on June 3rd and stayed until June 7th. I have been to Vegas several times but never stayed at Cesar's Palace. On this trip, my friends and I stayed at the Julius tower room 300 something all the way at the end of the lobby, the walk to the room every night was the most annoying thing but that isn't what I wanna complain about. Im here to complain about the horrible service that I received by the pool. I spent every single day 7am-3pm by the pool. Here is my first complaint, the ""snack bar"" doesn't open up until 11 AM. If you wanted to have breakfast by the pool that was not an option unless you ate inside of the hotel and even so you cannot bring any outside food or drinks to the pool area. what's the point of relaxation when…"
Caesars Palace,Expedia,"as always, quality experience in the gaming area, though day-time waitresses can be a little more friendly.  Gaming area is always very clean.  Good location.  I've never stayed at Caesars but will consider it for a future visit. "
The Palazzo at The Venetian,Expedia,"Beautiful and luxurious suite with 3 lcd tv's and large marble bathroom.  The view of the Wynn and the mountains from our room was stunning.  Loved the smell of the new carpet and furnitures.   Loved the decor of brown with gold undertones and some splash of color.  Dark enough to be sophisticated but not somber and with just the right amount of glow. Perhaps, it was the relaxing bath in the soaking tub or perhaps it was the bed, but I got my eight hours of sleep and woke up so refreshed.  Their casion has the best looking and best dressed waitresses.  Of course, showing a lot of skin is a must for these waitresses but  their bronze/brown colored dresses with lace has an elegant feel to them.  A few restaurants and shops were open but probably not all will be open til spring of…"
The Palazzo at The Venetian,Expedia,"This hotel is the newst on the strip , I stayed there from Jan 7-10 2008 for the CES Show , I have stayed at all the hotels on the strip before and this property will be one of the best once all the kinks are starightened out , I didnt have a problem but others in my party did , From not having hot water to small things , but front desk was more then helpfull in anything , this hotel has over 3000 rooms and small hickups 6 days after opening is expected , I stayed at the wynn right after it opened and it was worse , the decor and layout is breathtaking and comparbale to other hotels in dubai not las vegas , its a classy and elegant property and I am sure that this property will be staying in the top tier until the Plaza las vegas is opened , I recomend this hotel greatlly and…"
The Palazzo at The Venetian,Expedia,"Wife and I were breathless the moment we stepped inside our room. The rooms are new and very luxurious! It’s like stepping in a luxury model home with all the upgraded amenities like 3 LCD TVs, including one in bathroom, remote control Roman Shades, marble countertops everywhere. There’s the bedroom, office table, living and dining room with all the new amenities! Everything is sleek, shiny and smells new! Indeed, it feels good to be one of the very first ones to enjoy the rooms. The bed was the most comfortable bed I’ve slept in. I only planned on sleeping 4 hours for the night and I ended up sleeping 8 and I didn’t regret it! I just couldn’t imagine any room better than this! The moment we checked in, staff we’re very pleasant and accommodating. Belldesk, Valet, and…"
The Palazzo at The Venetian,Expedia,"Care new Hotel with issues. I am sure issues will be sorted by Februaury but I had problems with room phone, AC, alarm clock, room cleaning, mini bar........ Now sometimes people helped and other times repeated calls were not answered despite assurances 'someone is on their way'. I think they were simply overwhelmed with opening week snagging issues. It will get better."
The Palazzo at The Venetian,Expedia,January 2-7/2008  My husband and I have been visiting Las Vegas three times a year for the last seven years.  And we've stayed at various hotels on the strip and have never been treated so rudely until now.  We had originally booked and prepaid for the Palazzo for our five night stay this time.  When we arrived at the Palazzo we were told we were being moved over to the Venetian.  The explanation given by the Palazzo front desk staff was they weren't opening up the rooms yet.  We had booked and paid three months prior.    We were looking forward to this vacation and to be only disappointed by the lack of customer service demonstrated by both the Palazzo and the Venetian hotel staff.  When we had complained to the Venetian Front Desk staff/manager about not being notified about…
