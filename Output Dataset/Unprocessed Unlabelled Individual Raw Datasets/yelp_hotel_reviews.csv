ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"The Security guy at the pool at Aria on September 16, 2020 around 12ish was rude and obnoxious the security tone with us was very unpleasant and off putting to say the least.  It felt like he didn't want my friend or I there and we even felt attacked attacked at one point to the point where the female security had to tell him to calm down.  We literally walked into the pool area and the security yelled and said LET me see your key card NOW and that you can't bring a drink in the pool area unless it's from Aria (which my drink was from the Aria lounge bar with the Aria logo on the clear cup big as day)  and to top it off the pool at the Aria was so small.  I will not be returning to the Aria ever again.  Not to mention the entrance of the Aria is lack luster nothing grand or to run home about."
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"ARIA is one of my favorite hot spots in Las Vegas!   The Buffet at Aria is on my top 3 list!  ARIA Patisserie, though pricey, lives up to being a true french artisan pastries, and the grassfed burger at the Burger Lounge melts in your mouth!I made $5,500 on this Las Vegas trip!  :- )"

ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"We have stayed at the Aria Resort and Casino many times in the past, but we typically have the same issues with each visit. Check-in: You have two options, wait in a very long line for an actual human to assist you or self check-in at the kiosks. We do self check-in every time but there are always hangups and technical difficulties whether with the ID scanner or the computer lagging. This time, the computer lagged very slowly just to have the system tell us our room was not ready even though it was after 7pm. Room: The strip-view rooms are truly a gamble. If you get a high floor room, the view may be better, but all strip rooms look down at the huge white structure that hangs over the vehicle drop off area. You really don't have the ability to people watch on the strip (at least with Deluxe rooms, can't speak for corner rooms). Our room in 15010 had very dirty windows, even though the resort had just opened that week after being shutdown for Covid. The a/c also was not working properly and our room was HOT. Middle of the night, thermostat set to 65, temp was 75. Casino: Smoking is allowed, some games shut off to allow for physical distancing. Not the best gambling floor on the strip in my opinion. Nearby Cosmopolitan just seems more fun to me. Restaurants: The buffet was still closed. But the restaurants that were open had the typical rude, elitist ""you're inconveniencing me"" type of attitude by its hosts/hostesses. We tried making a reservation at Javier's Mexican inside Aria and the hostess said we had to talk to the concierge. So we called concierge and they asked us if we had spoken with front desk of Javier's lol. Essentially we got bounced back and forth and ended up going to another property altogether for dinner. Pool: The pools are nice, but they are not deep. There are pools you have to pay extra for, but they are still swarming with children. We stuck to the free pools, and although we enjoyed ourselves, the lack of umbrellas and overall shade was really tough after just a couple of hours in 101 degree heat. Servers do come around asking for drinks, but they are not consistent. We mostly had to leave the pool and get our own drinks. The pool staff accommodates to large parties (tips) but not so much with parties of 2. There are suited security officers patrolling the pools separating people from stairways of the pool and ensuring distancing. However by midday, the 25-30 yr-old groups of 12 were congregating yet no one said anything. They will tell you to wear a mask when walking up to the pool bars, but if you're in a large group, they don't say anything which doesn't make sense. Also, if you approach the pool bar for water (desert, hello), be prepared for some pushback. Some bartenders are perfectly welcoming, others will say something snarky to you.Room Service Tablet: Very cool device, can operate room controls, temperature, shades, lighting, order room service and even adjust television. However, during our stay, the room service menu only said food was available between morning and midday. So we didn't order anything in the evening. I'm not sure if this was a glitch, but it was impossible to order food through the tablet, unlike previous visits. Checkout: You can checkout in person (wait) or on your phone/tablet. We walked past an employee at the entrance wheeling our luggage out and no one asked if we needed assistance or said good-bye. There is a taxi curbside pickup outside of the vehicle drop-off area but the employee working the taxi section had no information about how long the wait was and she was not very personable. We have never had an employee of Aria approach us and ask how we are doing or if we are enjoying our stay. I can't remember one person even smiling at us or saying hello during our time here. Although the location is excellent (connected to mall) and it is very close to Chick Fil A and other affordable dining, the customer service is really lacking at Aria and we have never left feeling valued or appreciated or even wanted, sadly. You can find great deals here, but my suggestion is to keep your expectations minimal and try to just go with it. Until next time Vegas."
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Beautiful casino, we enjoyed our stay all around. Check in was easy with the app download even though our electronic room key gave us issues and we had to go to the kiosk which was pretty slow. Staff was very helpful so we didn't mind at all. Room service is 6am to 2pm which was the only part of the stay I can complain about, not much food options at certain times of the day and night which is understandable because of the restrictions. Steak house was decent with great service and Catch was amazing with mediocre service. Casino follows the protocols, sanitized stations everywhere and even a washing station in the middle of the casino. Masks are enforced and mask stations are at every corner. I definitely felt safe.Our last night our safe would not open so we had called front desk and they sent Wil up to open our safe. He asked for my ID to verify before opening the safe and had us check inside to make sure everything is in place. He was genuinely nice and just seemed to love his job which is so rare to see. I honestly wrote this review because of him. He made my heart smile and Aria is lucky to have him in your team"
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"I was able to finally stay at the Aria Sky Suite for a weekend and boy was it worth it. They had a lounge but was closed unfortunately. But had another section that offered drinks and some snacks. The rooms in the sky suite is amazing with a fantastic view of The Strip, great technology, amazing decor, they don't have a kitchen but it does have a fridge but no microwave. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The bed was super comfortable. I love the bathroom it was glamorous, I wish the bathtub wasn't in the middle as water was spilling over and onto the floor. The casino level is entertaining and just a great lobby and place to stay!"
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Front desk was very nice.  Check in was quick and easy.  We had a corner double queen room and it was very clean.  Room came with a goody bag which contained two reusable masks, hand sanitizer, and two key rings that help you not touch door handles and slot machines.  Decent rooms at the price point.  I would highly consider booking here again.  All staff members we encountered were super friendly and helpful too!"
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Let's start with parking structure. Each parking spot has a light on top. Green or red which makes it easy to find a spot.Next is the check in area. They check your temperature and directs you to the counter. It only took 10 mins to check in which is not bad. But the thing is, you have a person in front of you that's not smiling or is happy with her job. Mask or no mask, you can tell if they are smiling. The room was ok. A view of the strip was an added bonus. The pool was great and exceptional customer service from the staff there. The housekeeping people on our floor, ""Excellent"". I love the way they cleaned the room. It's like your first day in the hotel. Checking out was easy."
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Ambiance 5Staff.         5Pricing.      4I had a great rime at the Aria with T. Great room with a wonderful shower ( tub was decent). Attentive and very friendly staff. Absolutely beautiful hotel. Loved walking the area in the morning when T was still asleep. Restaurants were all excellent, and plenty of variety. Our favorite, by far, was Bardot Brasserie. Everything there was soooo good! I'll go out of my way to go any time I'm there. Salt and Vine was very overpriced, from food to wine. Drinks were excellent, but again, overpriced. Many other fine choices for a very good meal around the area too. From fine to just seriously good, all within walking distance. If you're a higher limit gambler, you're fine, but lower betters are seriously penalized. Both here, and at other places on the strip. Table minimums were higher, and they cut your odds in various ways. Blackjack there's a forced progressing bet that is bad, roulette, they add a hotel slot, which gives another approximate 2.4% house advantage. Downtown offers better odds for lower betters. Talking to workers on the strip, it's agreed that strip hotels are banking in old timers that remember the better odds and complimentary offers will be gone soon, and the younger peopleWon't know any different.I would most definitely stay here again, but would plan my dining and gambling a bit more carefully next time."
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"I'm not one to complain really having worked in service and hospitality over 15 years, but Aria had terrible customer service. We were staying at Vdara and instructed to use the Aria pool during mid-week while the Vdara pool was closed.We spent over $150 on lunch while at the Aria pool and then we experienced the worst customer service dealing with the Aria security. We were walking back from the pool (and already wearing our masks) when we encountered security personnel from the Aria. He stopped my fiancé and told her and our 2 month year old that they could not use the lobby elevator without a room key.I explained to the ""customer service agent"" that we were coming back from the pool and that I had a room key in my swim trunks pocket.He asked me to put my shirt on, having come back from the pool, I listened immediately and put it on without any contest. Then he asked where we were staying again and my Fiancé reiterated that we were staying at the Vdara while I was digging in my pocket to show our room key.The security officer laughed in my fiancé's face and rudely tried to correct her pronunciation of ""Vdara"" by saying, ""You mean Vaaadara"".I couldn't believe this guys tone and audacity he was taking with our family.We were finally allowed to take the elevator back  down to the lobby level after being harassed and made to wait in a line (with no people in it). I immediately went to the first Aria employee (on the lobby floor) to explain our negative experience.Jason, the security guard on the lobby level, said that He heard I was refusing to put my shirt on..His officer, on the higher floor blatantly lied about our encounter to cover his own ass, and blamed us by saying we weren't complying to his ""orders"".We were then harassed by another associate, older lady, who followed us through the lobby.Again, in my 15 years in service and hospitality myself, I have never formally complained about anyone.Long story short...Don't waste you're money at the Aria with their over priced rooms, over priced food and terrible customer service."
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"We spent a relaxing five days at this amazing resort and casino. From the restaurants, to the staff, and yes the spa.  The decor and the lobby are very eye catching.  If I was to base my review on my experience with Kyle Patterson, Cameroon, Nica, and the other Sky Suites representatives I interacted with, I would give each individual a solid five stars. They went over and beyond in assisting me, answered my questions, and worked to produce positive resolutions without saying that word ""NO""The suites are beautiful and I especially loved how high up in the Sky we were.  The Spa is an absolute must. Everyone was so accommodating. Stand outs for me were the Ganbanyoku Heated Stone Beds, Outdoor Therapy Pool, and The Eucalyptus Steam Room. I found myself gaga over their vegan carrot cake. I'm not a gambler so Sky Suites, The Restaurants, and Spa made my trip. I also liked how everything was convenient, and accessible. They are connected viva  the tram, and loads of shopping is within your reach. They are also dog friendly and have an outdoor area downstairs located on the lower North Entrance. Please note they charge a fee for the stay. There is also a business center.  My first experience with them was great.  The gentleman who assisted me tracked the package and let me know when it would arrive.  I cannot say the same about today.  I was not notified when the package arrived. Had I not went to the center, I would have not known there was a FedEx for me. If I have to pay you a fee to handle my package please inform me on arrival & deliver to me.  Rather, I received a call to my room asking I if I had permission to charge $8.00 for an envelope. Within the realm of Sky  suites, I'd say management knows what they are doing. You can actually see the lines of communication which makes for wonderful guest experiences. I plan on returning to Aria Sky Suites and look forward to a five star experience from them. Thank you Sky Suites & Aria Spa for making of stay incredible!!!!"
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,The aria has great restaurants and is Covid safe. Their bar makes excellent drinks and If you like to gamble well guess what they are the casino to visit. I couldn't stop winning and end up playing in the casino for almost 5 hours after having a great dinner.
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Review on Chinese New Year decorations:I was at Aria on a Saturday afternoon in early January to see The year of rat decorations. Each year, Aria dies a great job of decorating for Chinese New Year. It is more to attract Asian visitors. They have year of rat banner displayed at the door entrances. Plenty of mini dragons displayed at the high slot lounge area. Also giant rat displayed next to the blossom restaurant. Next, giant Chinese lanterns are next to Buddha statue. Lastly, giant dragon hinged in the ceiling with money tree and dragons guarding the lobby. Just lovely and gorgeous to ring in the new year. This is one of the best time to visit. Tip: Park at self parking 1 hr free or pearl card to get free self parking area"
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"This review on the resort loungeI paid extra $ for the resort lounge and it's well worth the money depending on the person. It is located next to the aria cafe and concierge. During my stay on Sunday to Tuesday in November at Aria, we used the resort lounge. On a Sunday afternoon in early December, We walked in and scan our room key and walked upstairs to the receptionist to give our room number. Then I seen coffee machine that can makes coffee and hot chocolate or cappuccino or espresso.  The machines was easy to use and it makes delicious hot chocolate. During last 2 days, they had the same desserts and fruit slices. For breakfast till 12pm, they had egg and cheese muffin sandwiches, hash brown, pastries, toast, açaí bowls, watermelon or orange juice. For afternoon, popcorn, candied walnuts, pastries, slices of fruit. For 5-7pm, free wine and beer, cheese and crackers, kale salad, croistini with steak, slices of duck meat, roasted Brussels sprouts. We stayed there to relaxed and enjoyed the atmosphere. The servers were friendly and nice and they refilled the empty trays. I wished they bring back macaroons."
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"I stayed 2nights after Memorial holiday in May. I originally booked 2 comp rooms from myvegas then I got an upgrade email for higher floor room. I paid extra to get access to resort club on free drinks and eat complementary food.  My friend and I arrived early 12 noon and our room wasn't ready so we went to meet up an old friend for lunch. So during lunch, I got an text to say room was ready.  After lunch, we scanned our room key at elevator to reached our room on 29th floor  with 2 beds with view of strip. The beds were comfortable and the room looked clean.  We used the screen to open curtains and turned on tv which is way cool. Then we head to resort club for happy hour snacks and located next to concierge and had to scanned the room key to access it. Then the receptionist asked for our room and confirmed at her end. The space is spacious with dining tables and tv screen. They had fancy coffee machines, candy in jars, hot food items, such as salad, crackers with figs, Mac cheese, cheese crackers, fruit fusion water, sodas, water bottles. The wait staff were nice and kept refilling the food and clean tables and free wine and beer. They also served breakfast 7-11am, snacks 11-5, desserts 7-8. It helped me saved money on meals so I didn't have to venture out."
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"I came back to Aria to look for Xmas decorations on a Friday and Saturday in December. The line to check in wasn't long. I didn't want to wait for mobile check-in because you could wait longer than expected. The  clerk offered corner suite for $100 extra or have higher floor room $40 and I said no. So we got a room on 7th floor with the view of Aria valet parking. The room with king bed looked clean just dusty. Our remote didn't work so we had to call in for service. The tech person came and fixed it on a temporary basis. The bed was comfortable but the pillows are too soft. The size of bathroom was great. 3 stars on Minus on resort fees, parking fee. and tax on resort fees"
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"I came back to Aria to look at Xmas decorations on a Friday and Saturday in December. We originally purchased a regular king size room then got an upgrade offer $80 to stay at corner tower suite. So I agreed and did a mobile check-in and waited for email to get the key.  Our key allows access to tower lounge with unlimited soda, water bottles, coffee, and pastries or cookies. The room on the 29th has a nice view of Vdara and Cosmopolitan casino. The room had a living room, king size bed, and 11/2 bathroom which includes toto toilet and jetted bath. The bedroom was soft for my taste and it had a draft and tried warm up the room with cool remote control.  We also get turn down service which means they turn the bed covers, chocolates, and slippers. Second night, turn down service came at 10pm. Bad points: parking is $20 and bed is too soft. Otherwise great hotel to stay and love the tower lounge for free snacks."
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"I came after 2 days after Thanksgiving to celebrate my birthday. Originally I booked a regular room and received an email for $70 upgrade on a corner suite which I couldn't pass up. We parked our car in self parking free with pearl card and walk to Mobil check-in but got directed to the private lounge for check-in with lots of free drinks and snacks. My husband was very impressed because we didn't have to wait in the regular check-in line. The lady who helped us was very nice and friendly and got us a corner suite with view of planet Hollywood. The room was luxurious because it had a separate bedroom and 11/2 bathroom. The bathroom had a toto toilet with controls to clean your derrière, jet tub w/tv, shower, and 2 sinks.  The tv's has lots of channels and include Chinese cable tvb. The room comes with turn down service nightly which is nice. The lady who helped us surprised me a plate chocolate covered strawberries. Wow this is service. I had $100 dining credit and ate at Carbone and the food was delicious. Overall, I enjoyed my stay at Aria except crazy traffic leaving self parking at night. We were leaving self parking and got stuck in the long line of cars trying getting out of Aria due to over flow traffic of people trying to go to Park Vegas or new TMobile Arena. I went several times to private lounge with my room key to get more water, soda bottles, mandarin oranges. That is a great plus."
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"I came in a day early by mistake on my part because I got dates mixed up. Aria's Heidi and Jasmine reservation desk agents were very helpful got myself and husband a room a day after Thanksgiving at higher price although the place was booked. My husband didn't want to go somewhere else at a cheaper rate so paid higher price. Oh well. The line for reservation desk was long at 2ish pm but didn't wait too long. My room was on 10th floor with view of swimming pool. The room is very nice with King size bed. Too bad the bed was too soft for me. Kudos to Jasmine and Heidi for helping me. They were very friendly, helpful, and accommodating."
ARIA Resort & Casino,Yelp,"I love staying at Aria whenever I get a good deal by Mlife.  I arrive on a Sunday 12 noon and the line at the reservation is long of 20 minutes wait just like MGM Grand. Then I noticed a mobile check-in line and asked one of the employees there and its in beta format and if you book on the aria website not mlife website.  I wish the beta format is only for mlife not aria website.  I paid extra for 2 double beds and it was nice with roomy bathroom on 3rd floor.  The elevators are quick and don't have to wait so long like Mandalay Bay.  The beds are so comfortable and firm with goose down pillows.  The only problems are the bathroom lock doesn't work, desk lamp doesn't turn on, and bar counter was peeling off.  The checkout was easy by text message.  Tip is to valet for a short walk to reservation desk and charge everything to the room - buffet, restaurants, starbucks, jean phillipe to get Mlife points."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"We just got back from a relaxing stay at the Four Seasons, which was also our first time away from home during the pandemic. They've done a fantastic job of adapting to the current circumstances and making their guests feel safe and comfortable. They did enforce mask usage around the pool area, asking guests to wear them if they weren't eating or drinking or in the pool. Our kiddos were greeted with cute animal pouches and Four Season teddy bears. I had requested hotel slippers in advance for two adults and two kids and our room was stocked with them when we arrived. The two kid-sized robes were also a nice touch. As it was my birthday, they also gifted me with a small chocolate birthday cake, which was delicious. Thanks for another memorable stay, FS!"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Tried to make a reservation... closed during covid. Good for them; bad for me. Four Seasons, you're my home away from home on my next-next visit."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"What a pleasure to skate through writing a review because everything at the Four Seasons has always been perfect from start to end.Husband and I will only stay here when in Vegas, and we often go during the ""down"" period between Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve. This timing ensures that we have the place mostly to ourselves (or we have in years past) and we experience stellar one on one customer service. When my little pug was alive we would bring him and he was treated as a welcomed guest complete with his own doggie bed and biscuits spelled out in his name.The suites are stunning and we've always enjoyed the view as the location is on the top four floors of the Mandalay Bay. Being highly allergic to smoke, this is one of the few places where I don't get terribly sick. It's at the far end of the strip which is fine by me. I enjoy running down and back on the strip during sunrise as my wake up call.The dining is superb (excellent Christmas Eve and Day menus) and I really like taking advantage of the salon (which may be associated with Mandalay) daily. As husband and I don't gamble (okay, I spent $2 on slot machines the last time I was there), it's more than worth it to splurge on a suite with money left over for the various shows and exhibits. Be sure to check for specials where often the 3rd or 4th night is free.We'll be back!"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"This is the only place we'll stay in Vegas.  We come because it's calm in the middle of the storm that is Las Vegas.  I came for a friends 40th birthday recently, and we had a blast.Things you won't find here:  drunk stumbling misfits, any casino our associated chaos, women of the night.Things you will:  Understated elegance, quiet guests enjoying their time away from home, top-tier dining, concierge who will find even the most obscure item you ask for.  (He found a Poltergeist poster of Robbie, signed by the actor Oliver Robins and had it delivered to my room).Ask for that at any other hotel in Vegas, and they will not even know the first phone call to make. Thanks to FS Vegas for another spectacular vacation"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"First off, are there really four seasons of weather in Las Vegas!? This hidden gem located at the Mandalay Bay Resort has its very own entrance.The hotel is designed to not have a casino connected. Guests won't be able to hear a slot machine from their suites.All rooms are plush yet neutral in color.Each suite has incredible views, especially the 180 suite.My friend booked it for a weekend a few years back.  It was beautifully appointed but I prefer a hotel with a casino.  It was quite a walk to actually set foot at the Mandalay Bay. I'll add though, that the service was excellent.  Checking in didn't take more than 5 minutes. If ever I'm rolling in dough like my friend, I'd take my wife and son here at least for a night, then work our way back to where all the Vegas Action is!"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Absolutely amazing!! I attended a gala at this hotel for a charity event. Four Seasons most definitely holds true to their reputation. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The interior was beautifully designed, decorated & upkept. Our dinner was prepared by one of their head chefs and his team, and when I tell you this was some of the best tasting food, I'm not even slightly exaggerating! I was blown away with everything this hotel provided, all the way down to the amazing restrooms!"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"What an amazing , smoke free high end hotel !Four seasons is more reserved and relaxed from the usual Vegas hotel scene however it's just a short ride to the actionAmazing spa and facilities, concierge and staff a true 5 star experience one can expectToo bad it's off season just for a few more days so no pool however the outside pool area looks amazing. Will have to come backRoom amazing in the upgraded suite If one loves a ritz/four seasons classy and relaxed hotel experience elsewhere stay here in Vegas and go out for the fun, come back to relaxation"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"You can never go wrong when staying at the Four Seasons. I had such an amazing time it's going to be hard to keep my review short. I just love how pet friendly they are and how comfortable and clean the rooms are and how top notch the customer service is. But let me start from the beginning:Check-in: Everyone was incredibly nice. I just arrived from an 8 hour drive and before I could even ask if they had water someone brought me a bottle. It's like they can read minds! I've stayed at other hotels in Vegas before and usually when you check in there is a giant line and you have to wait over 40min to get your room key. You also feel like cattle. However, at the Four Seasons the whole process took 5min. Truly amazing.The room: There were macaroons and pet treats waiting in the room, which included a puppaccino with some carrots and cookies it was amazing! Also, the bedding is so plush that you don't want to leave. After getting all comfy and settled in the room the first night I arrived I realized I forgot my iPad in the car. The FS team is so amazing that when I called about it they sent someone to go grab it. Within 10min I had my iPad in hand. That is true luxury! Food: I ordered room service for breakfast a few times and dinner. It was delicious. I had the avocado toast for breakfast and a sandwich with beef in it. Food came within 30min and it was all prepared nicely so you feel like you have a mini restaurant table in your room. I also tried the breakfast buffet at the Veranda restaurant downstairs. So many options! They had a custom omelette bar, mini donut station (it was so cute) and so much other stuff. I honestly ate too much .Location: The Four Seasons is at one end of the strip which I personally love. You feel like you can get away from all the hustle and bustle of Vegas while still being in it."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"How can a Four Seasons get just three stars?  Well, to be fair, most Las Vegas hotels don't get many stars because they rip you off with a resort fee; which is one of the worst kinds of bait and switch in the business.  But they all do it, and I think worse of every single one of them for it.  You have to be exemplary in order to overcome the deficit here.The check in experience is friendly and quick - an improvement over just about every other hotel.  You also don't have to go through a casino to get to your room, which is a bonus. In terms of facilities; the bed is super comfortable, the room is large, there is a decent desk to work at, and the shower amenities are great.  So, everything you need.  There is a lightning adapter on the alarm clock, but you have to take the case off your phone to use it.  There is plenty of power sockets, and a usb charging point.  The WiFi is nothing special, and drops constantly, so I wasn't impressed there.The coffee, for which your ""resort fee"" pays, is a Keurig machine, and is among the worst of the worst coffee I have ever tasted.  It is vile.  If you are going to extort money from me and claim ""it's for the coffee"", that coffee had better be better tasting than hot water wrung through a dirty blanket.In terms of morning breakfast, see my other post on Verandah.  However, note that it is expensive, and you may be better off venturing out onto the strip for breakfast.  We spent $60 and it wasn't that good. It was a good breakfast, but expensive.As far as hotels in Las Vegas, this is probably the best I've stayed in.  It's just hotels in Las Vegas has to make up for, well, Las Vegas and this one doesn't do that."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"MMMMM what makes it different from other hotels?  Let's begin with just the valet, these guys welcome you with a smile right away, i was even trying to pull a 5 from my purse and the nice gentleman told me ma'am you go ahead and enjoy we will do that later. WOW! .....The minute you walk in here you tell it's different. It does not smell like cigarette smoke , it just smells clean. The restaurant is fabulous! I know ....I know ...what is vegas without the dinganing ning sound of the machine BUT..... you can have that in the whole stretch of the strip! So of you want to be in a sophisticated woooohzaaa kindda hotel. Come to the Four Season!"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,This is the second year in a row working CES with the Disney company. Everyone I met last year was still working this year at the Four Seasons Hotel. I literally hugged some of them like we were family that haven't seen each other in ages. The time we spent in the hall getting to know everyone was priceless. And everyone from the security team to the ladies at the nail bar was super nice. This years CES is over but I'm looking forward to next year seeing all my Four Season Buddies.
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"The Four Seasons in Las Vegas is neither a typical Four Seasons nor a typical Vegas hotel. Matt B. and I spent two nights there when we went to Vegas about a month ago. We booked our stay pretty late and it cost about the same number of points as the Aria, and not much more than hotels in the next tier down. We figured in that case, why not stay in a Four Seasons?It was a very nice hotel, sort of a luxury wing of the Mandalay Bay, in the same building but with a separate entrance, separate lobby, and separate staff, with rooms on the upper floors. There was easy access to the Mandalay Bay and its casino, but the Four Seasons didn't have a casino of its own--a good thing when I came back from gambling at the MGM at 4:30 in the morning and didn't have to pass through a pit of temptation on my way to the elevator and my sleeping husband.Our room was attractive and comfortable, if without the wow factor you might expect from a Four Seasons. The decor was kind of generic, and there was a weird empty space in our room that looked meant for a sofa that wasn't there. The bed was fine. The bathroom was pretty, but the shower was small.We took advantage of the Four Seasons pool one afternoon, and that was pretty great, quiet and not at all crowded, with attendants to set up our loungers and take drink orders. The service on that front was a bit slow and spotty, though, and the guy helping us brought Matt the wrong drink. When he asked for the right one, the server took the wrong one back to throw away--I love free drinks, so this is a pet peeve of mine. Not to complain too much about the Four Seasons pool, which was definitely super nice.I had a good time at the Four Seasons, but I don't know that I'd come back, just because it's neither a special over-the-top luxury hotel nor a fuck-yea embrace-the-Vegas blingfest. If you just want a fancy, quiet hotel, though, this might be the place for you. It's more affordable than most Four Seasons, and the short distance from a casino might spare you some poor decisions."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Best hotel on The Strip, possibly anywhere. The staff were all around wonderful. The rooms have great views and are large. Good finishes. The retreat from the Casio noise and banter is welcome. The price point is high on anything you buy on site. The best coffee with a short walk at the McDonalds across the street."

Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"If smoky casinos aren't your thing, Four Seasons is your best bet for gambling away your savings in Sin city. The five star hotel occupies the top five floors of Mandalay Bay and stands out as a non-gaming oasis. They offer relaxing rooms, delicious food (don't miss the breakfast buffet), and rejuvenating spa treatments where you can unwind after avoiding other people's regrettable behavior. The rooms themselves are smaller than one would expect for the price point and could honestly benefit from a minor facelift. The only other attribute worth noting is that the property is located at the end of the strip which means walking is not the best option when shopping the city. But the hotel offers black car service and a park bench ensconced in palms trees where you can wait for an Uber. Unlike that surly card dealer with the grumpy look on her face, the staff at Four Seasons Las Vegas will smile ear-to-ear and treat you like royalty while taking all your money. So let that jaw drop as you enter the beautiful lobby, and drop again when they hand you the bill on your way out. Wasting hard-earned money is my middle name."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"What a beautiful hotel! Let me start by saying we do not smoke, gamble or 'party' the way most do in Vegas. So we appreciated having a quiet place to stay away from it all. Our room was lovely, super comfortable bed, clean everything, so quiet-- perfect place to escape the chaos of the strip. Front desk ladies, parking attendants were all very kind. We often used the 'hotel car' which was much nicer than any taxi or Uber we took during our stay. We definitely recommend to anyone looking for a classy, relaxing experience.... We'll definitely stay here when we come to Vegas from now on."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"This was the second time that I did high tea here at the four seasons. It was a very nice tea. The place is elegant & the service is pretty good. The teas that we chose weren't the best; mixed berry and silver something. The silver something barely had any taste. But, it was already 3 o'clock, so I don't want to get anything too strong. I wish that they would have tea at 12 or 1 o'clock like it other places. Vet, you have a choice of either three or 4 o'clock.The scones are wonderful and there are two, one was plain & the other one was black currant. Their Devonshire cream, lemon curd and strawberry preserves are all very tasty. The desserts were pretty good, I liked three of them. We splurged for the Prosecco and I think it was a good choice. As the Prosecco doesn't have too much of an alcohol content and you can still drive if you need to.As for the sandwiches, you only get four and they're super tiny. I mean I go to a lot of different teas & I have to say that these are probably the smallest that I've had. All in all, it was pretty nice."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"The classiest hotel on the Strip.So nice to have a non-gaming hotel in town!  And non smoking as well....how great is that?!  Others need to follow... refreshing to breathe clean air and to be in a dignified and upscale atmosphere, which is sorely lacking in most all of Las Vegas.Service was also very good and as expected with a FS property.Look forward to coming back!"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,We didn't stay here but we had breakfast at the restaurant near the pools. Great food although service was kind of slow. Would return for breakfast.
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"I have not stayed at the Four Seasons, although my friend had several years back. I have come in a couple of times to Veranda, the restaurant inside the Four Seasons. Each time I have come in, it has been a pleasant experience.This is a proper hotel which is next to Mandalay Bay where all the action is. Four Seasons does not have slot play or any gaming, you can walk into MB for that. This is a class act hotel with a luxury vibe to it. I have seen one of the rooms when my friend was staying and it was a very nice room from what I saw for 10 minutes. My friend and her family really enjoyed her stay here and I trust what she says.The valet service here is free if you dine at Veranda and get your ticket validated. The restaurant is very nice (see my review) as well as the bar if you want a drinkie. I have also sat at the bar, of course, and had a couple glasses of prosecco with friends. Everyone from the valet attendants, the bar tenders to the other staff have always been pleasant and friendly. Hospitality is key, even if you are visiting for a few hours. All a very nice experience in a lovely hotel. If I were to stay on The Strip, I would prefer a small hotel experience like Four Seasons which is tucked away from the madness. Although it is close enough to the Vegas madness if you want it!"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"I always look forward to my stay at the SkyLofts ! Lea does a great job looking out for us and making sure we are comfortable. Brittany, down at the pool complex is without a doubt the best cabana attendant out there (well, maybe she has some competition with David, LOL). And Randall our butler make sure all our in-suite needs are taken care of. Great staff, great property, looking forward to coming back soon!"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"With the MGM Grand just recently being sold to Blackstone Group, I hope nothing changes in terms of quality and service. With the MGM Groups attempt to make a big splash in the Japan Gambling Market the company was forced to take a huge financial move recently by literally selling off some of its most popular and valuable properties.If anything else, thanks for all the good times!"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"During my solo trip to Vegas in April I got to stay here when they upgraded my initial suite.  Starting off the day lucky already.  I was in town looking at some real estate so it was gonna be a taxing day.  Luckily this suite is amazing.  My suite was two stories with a beautiful balcony view.  The bathroom was amazing.  It had a heating bathtub and power shower.  Never experienced that before so that was super cool.The bed was super comfortable and I slept like a baby.  Everything was so nice at this loft I just wanted to stay an extra day, but sadly I was only in town for one night.  If I do come back I would definitely consider this spot again.  Also forgot to mention room service was outstanding.  The shrimp cocktail is by far my favorite thing to get, but the wings weren't too bad and the soup was nice.  Yeah I was craving soup...."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"The food and beverages at the Skylofts are impeccable. I would recommend the skylofts for any event you may have, from weddings and receptions to company events they offer a food and beverage package that is excellent, best that Vegas has to offer"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"Highly recommend partaking in an experience such as this! From the moment we arrived even after we downgraded to a regular room. We were still honored with skyloft customer service until the departure ofOur stay. I was hesitant of being treated like ""poor folks"" since I'm sure they are used to having wealthy clientele. Contrary to my fears, I was treated no different and wasn't asked to spend extra money on incidentals and services. They press your clothes, make your coffee, turn down service and remember your name. They went above and beyond, I'm grateful and will definitely be back. Every request was accommodated with quality and expedient effort. Thank you to Selena and the rest of the skyloft team. See y'all next year."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"I don't even know where to begin, as this was a perfect fit for a princess. I needed time away so that I could really focus on me, but also be in a city where if I wanted to have fun, that was also an option. I have no idea how the Skylofts manage to take you literally into a whole different planet completely opposite of Las Vegas, with just an elevator ride down to all the action, but that is exactly what they did!When I arrived I was greeted by the most impressionable butler Jojo. As soon as you reach the top Skyloft floor, it's as if you enter the gates of heaven, well one could at least hope heaven is like this. Jojo poured my fresh squeezed juice, and then showed me around my suite. I could hardly process what he was saying, as I was captivated by the views, and the wonderful amenities that surrounded me in this beautiful room. He even offered to unpack my items. As I mentioned, I needed a place to focus, and this place was so quiet so incredibly quiet.I came in on a Saturday, and left on a Tuesday. Throughout my stay I was able to go to shows, hang out with friends, enjoy the pool, eat wonderful dinners, fly on an amazing helicopter ride, and have all this at the ease of a text, or a button. You see when I showed up, I really didn't have many plans. Having a concierge 24/7 on the same floor as your suite, or just a phone call away, really made my time peaceful and exciting at the same time. They booked everything for me! When I say I was a princess, I actually should say I felt like a queen. There was turn down every evening with amazing chocolates, beautiful flowers each night on my bed, little notes, and the Butler's even drew me a bath with the most amazing bath salts. The shampoo and conditioner as well as the lotion comes already equipped by Bulgari, which is one of my favorite designers. Did I mention as a part of your stay they pick you up and drop you off wherever you need to go?!? I literally could go on and on and on about this experience, but at some point you will become overloaded with so much information, so I will leave the surprise and the "" wow ""factor up to you, but this is a must stay, and by far out of my 37 years of life, my favorite stay anywhere !!!! I have nothing bad to say about anyone, as every single person goes above and beyond to make sure that you are completely and thoroughly taken care of, but I chose to point out these selective people because they REALLY went above and beyond for me, and I will definitely be returning to see you Jojo with Butler services, Jessica with concierge, Stewart Patchefsky General manager, David Bohanon Hotel operations manager, and Art the Casino host.I wish that I took photos, but I was so captivated by the moments that I spent in room, and out of the room, that I actually chose to enjoy the moments rather than to be on my phone ( something I have not been able to do for a very long time ) I know that had I of chosen a different place to stay, my trip would not even have come close to what it was. I am so grateful and thankful.  Skyloft, you have spoiled me so much, I don't feel I will ever be able to stay anywhere else"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"Awesome rooms but a couple design flaws in the one we were staying in. First, the pool table room was too small for the pool table. Certain shots were impossible because you didn't have the space to navigate. People actually play pool ok MGM, it's not for decor. Second, the staircase was smack dab in the middle so all the first floor rooms encircled it. So instead of having some relatively large areas to congregate, you had to split up into small groups...not ideal when you're in Vegas tryna party.Then the alcohol situation: I guess they require you to source all your alcohol through them and an insane marked up price. That's a bit ridiculous but hey, no one spends this much on a room to complain. Stupid rule though. I'm split between a 3 and a 4 star review but the rooms were really nice. The design flaws may not exist in every single one too so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"I am obsessed with these rooms. I am pretty sure you have to be a big gambler or celeb to stay here but if you can, do it! The service is 5star. By far the best butler service in Las Vegas (I've stayed everywhere and yes, better than the Mansions and Cosmo Penthouse). Joey is the sweetest! The drivers are such beautiful people. Neil is my fave! I love the MGM in general but staying here makes me never want to leave. Great rooms for crazy after parties. Loft style. Just SEXYYYYYYYYY. The robes are sooooo cozy."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"2nd time staying at the Skylofts (2 story suites) at MGM Grand and really LUV the grand luxe interior, chic homey feel, high volume ceilings, stellar service, plush beds, electronic controls for each master suite bedroom, beautiful bathrooms with walk in closets, robes, slippers, infinity soak in bath tubs, courtesy limo & Maybach services to & from airport.The 3 bedroom suite is 6,000 SF & spacious!!!The VIP concierge & personal butler/hosts are extremely accommodating.Skylofts consistently exudes pampering, elegance, & class.."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,I only stay here when I come to Vegas. Service is 10/10 and the room is beautiful. The on call butler and 24/7 service is the perfect treat for a weekend or week getaway.T. Pve
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"On our recent trip to Vegas, BF's boss got a two story, two bedroom Skyloft for us to hang out in. He and the other owner of the company stayed in the bedrooms upstairs, but the downstairs was for us to spend time in.The loft was gorgeous. It was a 3,000 square foot space with a dining room, breakfast nook, three living areas, a pool table, floor to ceiling windows, and beautiful decor. The bedrooms upstairs were amazing, and the bathrooms were just fantastic. Highlights included:Getting picked up from the airport by a Rolls Royce - since our party was so big, we obviously all couldn't fit in that, so they also sent a limo and a party bus. We had the same transportation back to the airport when the trip was over.Butlers greet you in the loft and help you get settled in.A bartender is also there to prepare cocktails and pour any beer/wine that you want.The loft is set up to pair with Bluetooth, so we could all play whatever music we wanted from our phones, and it played throughout the entire loft.Anything we wanted we had in no time - food, drinks, whatever. I must say, staying in Vegas will not be the same again. I have stayed at numerous hotels, and nothing has compared to this. Hopefully someday I can get some friends to go in on the cost of one of these lovely Skylofts so I can stay here again!"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"I stayed at the SKYLOFTS a second time recently. The first time I was in their 2-bedroom, and this time I was in their one-bedroom. Once again, this place was amazing. The rooms are appointed so nicely. The technology and integration in the rooms are so cool. The immersion steam shower is out of this world. New this time was a texting system. Instead of having to call the butlers or concierge for anything, I texted them, and I could do it from anywhere.For example, I was out at a show, I texted them to make up my room, perform turn-down service, and stock the fridge with fresh drinks. I come back to the room, and everything is done to perfection.Recommendations: Use their airport pickup service. It is complimentary for 2 bedrooms, and extra for 1. It creates a seamless experience that begins when you get your bags. You get your bags, get in the car, arrive at the MGM, and from that point forward, you are taken care of.Dine at The Mansion! As a guest of the Skylofts, you have the ability to dine at The Mansion. Set it up with the concierge. I had breakfast there, and it was a surreal experience. The Mansion is a part of the MGM that is designed for super high-rollers and VIPs--there are 29 private Villas that overlook a climate controlled atrium, and there is a dining room with seats in the courtyard. Anyway, we were only one of two tables dining at that time, and I have to say, the service was amazing. Everything about that experience was amazing. So ask the concierge for reservations at The Mansion. You will not regret it.In summary, you should stay here. Don't even think twice. They treat you like royalty. The only bad part about the SKYLOFTS is leaving. You don't want to leave."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"I've stayed here twice and I liked the room design. It is very spacious and the people working here are friendly. You're always greeted every time you get to the floor or leave the floor. The bathroom amenities are by Bvlgari. The room service menu also looked quite extensive. There was a very large selection of Chinese food. They also offered bird's nest, abalone and a bunch of more interesting eats."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"5 stars all the way.I think we will stay here every time we come to Vegas! It does get expensive, but its worth EVERY penny:Pros:-private lobby with snacks and beverages-private butler -private elevator where you have to swipe your card for Skyloft access -rolls royce airport pick up and drop off-AMAZING loft complete with Bang and Olufsen electronics and a Crestron All-In-One remote control that literally controls everything from the drapes to the TV-complimentary beverages in the loft-complimentary movies on demand (they have all the new ones like Frozen, etc) They even have an LCD TV screen in the bathroom mirror LOL-huuuge shower/sauna steam room.  It's a 6 jet shower that literally attacks you with water in every direction haha-free (fast) wifi-access to dine at the Mansion (so worth it)-last minute reservations to Joel Robuchon I can go on and on.  They really go out of their way to make you feel special. It was Valentine's Day weekend and the hubby requested some flowers; they brought up room service with a rose and had a huge beautiful vase of a dozen long stemmed roses waiting for me after breakfast at  the Mansion.  They also accommodated our late check out request and all our dining reservations.  From start to finish the service was impeccable, the rooms luxurious and quiet, and even the room service menu was divine!This is the one place in Vegas where I can confidently say that staying in the loft is more fun then venturing out into the strip.  If you are looking for a romantic getaway, stay here! You won't regret it.  We will be back soon!"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"I was in Vegas twice within three weeks for two separate trade shows. Both events were coincidentally hosted at the MGM Grand... and I was definitely not looking forward to being stuck at the same hotel for two weeks! But my boss decided to book Skyloft rooms for client and prospect meetings on both occasions. These rooms are spacious, new, and always clean - a huge step up from their standard rooms. You definitely get what you pay for. Their staff is extremely attentive, calling for service is quick and responsive. Being a guest at the Skyloft gives you access to The Mansion for private dining. We had a company dinner with a custom menu... and it was delicious. I decided on the mansion bisque, bryant farm filet, and chocolate raspberry cake. Everything was so so good. Just look at my pictures!I was very impressed with how luxurious it was, since I'd probably never book one of these rooms on my own. If I could afford to, I'd probably stay here every time I'm in Vegas. The location is convenient too since it's right in the middle of the Strip."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"Best place to stay inside MGM!!  The service is phenomenal when you stay at the skyloft. Everything feels so luxurious and grand. I truly feel like I'm getting pampered when I stay here!! Once the elevators open to skyloft floor my first initial thought was woooweee where am I? They serve you welcome juice when you first arrive, the front desk, staff, and butlers are  friendly... They have great room service food and cam deliver or pickup anything you wish.  But of course that comes with a tip. There's are tvs all around and you get free movies all day, and their own Bvlgari line of toiletries smell refreshing. It always reminds me of skyloft!  Their shower looks amazing,  probably every girls dream or even kids if they like to play in the tub. When you stay here you are treated as VIP from the minute you arrive till you leave. They can pick you up at the airport to dropping you off at the mall and picking you back when you are done. You get your own  limo guy to chauffeur you around. They make everything so easy for you!!! Sometimes they pick you up in a Rolls Royce Ghost, Maybach,  and I wouldn't be surprised if they had the Phantom!! If the kids are bored you can order a gaming system that include PS3 Playstation etc..  They normally have either a Foosball or pool table area for entertain depending what size loft you get..  The biggest one comes with a patio area that include a jacuzzi overlooking the strip. You can even ask the staff to bring you a humidifier if you wanted to. They even have a booklet about certain kinds of pillows like a snoring pillow or a rejuvenating one... It's hard to go back to a regular room after staying at skyloft so many times. But I love the sky loft!! It's my 2ns home, can't wait to come back. I can honestly say this is one place that can be more fun than actually venturing outside to the casino area. You must try at least once in your life!"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"I expected more. And for the price, so should everyone else.Had a deal to celebrate, so a bunch of us went down to Vegas and rented an MGM SkyLoft as our home base. Yes, the room is cool - but nothing overly spectacular and I found it underwhelming in truth. The concierge is lovely, helpful - but the rest of the services are rather...meh. The butler service, or at least - the lady we had been assigned - irritated me most. A person assigned to be on call wasn't all that happy to be. She mostly rolled her eyes and/or made a sarcastic remark at every request we made to navigate the room, services or preferences, giving us all the sense that you had bothered her every single time you asked for something, then also found the nerve to stand with her hand rather pointedly outstretched and eyes elsewhere before she left, only to come back next time with the same rolled eyes and comment routine, regardless of how much you might have tipped her.$1000+ per night should get you great services and access to the very best they have to offer. From access to clubs, pool cabanas and other services - when you pay the most you get the best. Not here. Renting a SkyLoft doesn't even get you complimentary, or even - paid access to their own Nightclubs, for fuck sake. Want to go to Hakkasan? Get in line. Other than that, MGM SkyLoft is not a VIP experience you want to take your clients or celebrations to. Its just a big room with a separate elevator and thats where the VIP experience ends. Honestly, for the price - its a fucking joke, quite like most MGM experiences. Shibuya is overpriced, has terrible service and disappointing fish. Hakkasan is an overcrowded cheeseball pit. The hotel is the same. Its all just way too large, impersonal, expensive, less than memorable but frankly, disappointing. Should have gone elsewhere. MGM is a never again for me."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"This place is awesome. That's what I can say about this place. Maybe I would be here often if place was cheaper. Lol. Or maybe complimentary? Lol. Exceptional service and a must place to go to. Need i say more. Not really, this place speaks for itself. Great job!"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"If you dont give this place 5 star I will slap you. You get whatever you want with the greatest service.  Just by you staying here and you want to bring your bottles from the club you will and they will attach a bodyguard as well.  Rolls Royce everywhere you go. Incredible service. You are the King of vegas when you are here with the skyloft.  I want to live there.but.. it is $10,000 per night.. so its not cheap."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,Yelp,"Enjoy being spoiled. The butler and concierge will do everything for you from the instance you step out of the airport and back in. Feel like a VIP! Where some celebs stay at :)Soffered by Rolls Royce Ghost: Thirsty, water is on the side and sit back for a nap before MGM. Then roll up to the Skyloft entrance with a small office with a concierge there, next to general. Cab/Limo: Roll through the concierge area to get a ride from the doorman.MGM Pool: Wet Republic Event usually is free unless there is an event then there is a price. Ask the concierge to contact a hostess for you, so you can get the tickets from there and just walk in (skip the lines).Butler/Service: Superb. You'll get your items within 10minutes. Butlers are pretty chill. This place definitely knows how to make you feel at home. Call as many times as you like.Rooms: 2 stories. 2 Rooms is pretty awesome, still can have them bring roll away beds for the 2 extra living rooms downstairs. You have one bigger common area with a view, dining room with small fridge for your unlimited free water and soda. Foosball or Pool Table in one area (depends on your place), one downstairs bathroom, Two bathrooms upstairs with a grand closet, nice showers with 3 different  sprays and 2 infinity tubs, tvs in mirrors. And everything controlled basically by remote (curtains, music, lighting, etc). Con is the remote doesn't work very well, de-sensitized? P.S. The shower water is definitely purified, feels awesome on your skin.Includes: Unlimited water and soda. Slippers, random amenities. espresso tea machine, the usual etc. Menu is pretty pricey (2 eggs for around $22+?).We ordered Cake Pops from cmycakeslv.com to be delivered and it was awesome! Its not part of MGM, so you'll have to go downstairs to bring them up to you guys. Super nice! And delish! They're fb page: facebook.com/cmycakeslv. Wonder if the butler can pick these up for us next time.Elevator: Enter via general entrance with back door entrance to elevators to Skyloft or enter through conceriage area straight to the elevator. Enter your skyloft card to get to the skylofts. Yes like Victoria L. says....""Can I live here? Permanently?"""
Encore,Yelp,"Almost a month ago ago, I was in town for six days, used my M Life for a few perks, and stayed at the MGM.  Due to Covid-19, things are obviously different these days.   I'm not really a smarmy bastard, but the people coming out to Vegas, staying at MGM seemed especially ghetto.  Friends who live in Vegas said that for awhile now it really has been ghetto fabulous.   Apparently there's been shootings on the Strip every weekend.  Well, I decided go  out again over the following weekend.   The Vegas friends told me that they couldnt believe how low Encore rates were for the weekend.   That led me to Encore.   I haven't stayed here in years. All I can tell you is that I was reminded all over again why I really loved the Wynn when it first opened, and now Encore.  During pandemic, all of the staff treated me with complete care, and my stay was so good. If they keep the low rates going, I'm coming back as much as I can.   (Although, apparently they're not open during the week right now.)"
Encore,Yelp,"There's plenty of places to stay on the Strip, but once you stay at the Encore... you'll never want to stay anywhere else.Even in the midst of the pandemic, our stay was fantastic. We took advantage of the Travel + Leisure deal that offered $150 dining credit, $50 drink credit, and late checkout in addition to a discounted room rate -- score! Upon check-in, I informed the (very friendly) receptionist that we were in town to celebrate my fiance's birthday, and she graciously offered us an upgrade to a higher floor suite room. The room was impeccable -- clean, luxurious, and spacious (apparently, it's one of the biggest on the Strip). I loved how the layout of the room separated the sleeping and living room areas nicely; it made it easy for one of us to relax in bed while the other worked remotely from the couch. The entire room is Alexa-enabled, which while functional, is just a lot of fun to play around with (I liked using my voice to dim the lights or open up the curtains). In addition to the room, my favorite part of our stay were the pools -- as a guest of the Encore, you also have free reign to the Wynn's pools, so we spent one day lounging at both. Check out the Wynn if you want a larger, more vibrant experience; the Encore pool is a little more low-key, which is perfect for just lounging. Compliance with COVID was excellent and some of the best we've seen on the Strip (in these times, walking around the Strip is just not a great idea lol). They check your temperature upon arrival, have hand sanitizer stations everywhere, and even have free masks. I'm already excited at the prospect of coming back!"
Encore,Yelp,"We had a great stay at this hotel.The rooms are very spacious, clean and updated. We got lucky and were upgraded to the top floor and the view from the 63th floor is amazing. Everybody was very pleasant and they are doing a great job disinfecting the public areas of the hotel due to Covid. The pool is beautiful and the lobby decoration is gorgeous!"
Encore,Yelp,"From the Hotel Manager, The Corporate Security staff;To the cleaning personnel, the waitresses etc.... =In my opinion, I believe you will have a very hard time finding a more professionally ran operation.So clean, so elegant, so safe = My wife and I love everything about The Encore Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, NV.  Cutting edge technology during pandrmic times go unsurpassed for sure beyond any shadow of a doubt. Also The Fantastic Las Vegas Metro Police officers work hand in hand with Hotel Executives to ensure our safety while on Hotel Premises. Obviously Las Vegas Metro Police are very Professional and kind while doing a fantastic job all the time.I suggest The Encore, and The Wynn resorts to all World Wide.....Fabulous Pools and Restaurants and all of the employees are happy and helpful. My wife and I can not find anything negative about thisResort. I can only suggest to all that this is the stock to buy now. Looking forward to our next vacation At this Wonderful Las Vegas Resort.  10-3-2020..."
Encore,Yelp,No valet? That's the new Vegas or some of the cuts they have to make with this nonsense covid lockdown stuff. Not as bad as we have it in L. A. AND Cali but still!Room is beautiful and clean. Staff is very friendly! Will see how much money I lose at the tables. Hopefully there won't be too many winey Dems at the roulette tables annoying me.
Encore,Yelp,"I recently had a lovely staycation at Encore. As a local I love checking out the hotels on The Strip. During these times it's as close as I'm going to get to a vacation. Check-in (3:00) was easy and done by kiosk instead of with an employee. Check-out (12:00) was done by phone so I just left the keys and my receipt was emailed to me. The walk from my car in the Encore garage to my room door was less than 10 minutes! This is rare and a true selling point. The room itself was clean with a great layout. A large hall leads to the bed area and a partial wall separates a sitting area. The bathroom was spacious. The bed was very comfortable for a good night's sleep. I found plenty of outlets to charge my phone. The only disappointment was the terrible shower head that couldn't be controlled. For a longer stay this would have ruined the experience.Staff around the building was friendly, but kept a distance to be safe. My only service complaint was in regards to housekeeping opening my door twice during my stay. The first was an hour after I checked in so I thought they were knocking for the room next to me. The second was two hours before checkout time, but they didn't even knock that time. Thankfully I had the lock in place both times.As far as fees, parking in the self parking garage is free. The resort fee is $45 per night. Encore and Wynn had great safety precautions in place. In the room they provided a tube of hand sanitizer, masks, and alcohol wipes. Hand sanitizer dispensers were in abundance all over the properties. Masks were worn by all employees. The restaurants had tables properly spaced. Gaming areas had every other seat removed or plexiglass up. In the bathroom they even covered every other sink so that customers don't come too close to one another.Indoor walkways connect to Wynn. This means there are plenty of restaurants, shopping, gambling, and bars available without stepping into the heat. A mere three minute step into the heat on the overhead walkway allows access to The Palazzo and Venetian. This was one of my favorite Vegas staycations. A great room and easy access to great restaurant options."
Encore,Yelp,"What a pleasant experience. From check in to check out. I ironically had the same lady check us in and out and she was super sweet and helpful!As you walk in from the self parking garage, there is security with what seems to be checking temperatures. The front desk is directly after that to your right side. They are enforcing social distancing & have hand sanitizer stations throughout. We stayed on level 18. Beautiful king bed room with a huge window with a view! The room was equipped with an Alexa device, and she was awesome! Closed and opened curtains, lowered the lights... there was also a device next to the bed that had all these options as well.The bathroom was pretty big. I love the setup of the room. The tv can turn from one side to the other so you can watch from the bed or from the couch. Desk included. Lots of outlets for your gadgets.We walked around and employees were all wearing masks. Guests, however, were not. I'd say 50% of people wearing masks. Us, included. Surprisingly? But also not surprisingly. If you're afraid I'd still say stay home. But for what it was worth, the stay was amazing. We kept our distance from others and kept our masks on in public. Ps, pool is cute. Need reservations to go in!"
Encore,Yelp,"I should probably ask someone at The Encore whether it's part of The Wynn or an actual separate hotel altogether. And yes, I know his Ex-wife got custody of the Encore in the settlement. From what I can see, it may be a newer extension of The Wynn. Either way, The Encore is just as luxurious and well maintained as The Wynn. And it has the same Steve Wynn touch as all his hotels have. The Encore is a little newer, and therefore the rooms are designed with slightly more panache, but they both are top-notch five-star hotels. The service isn't equaled anywhere in Las Vegas, and the food is superlative. The Encore has two pools, where The Wynn has four. I prefer The Wynn pools, but I know many people who like the Encore pools' more subdued and stately feel.Say what you will about Steve Wynn and his ""legal issues."" The fact is the man understands hotels better than anyone. The Wynn and The Encore were his crowning glory over the 40-years he was in Las Vegas."
Encore,Yelp,"*Covid Update*After an enjoyable stay during Covid at the Wynn, we decided to come back here. We had a minor hiccup at the Wynn, nothing major (see my Wynn review for details) but was given an immediate reply and a one step upgrade from Guest Relations. Totally 5 star treatment all the way, kudos Wynn and Encore! So for the upgrade, I thought I would try the Encore just for comparison. During Covid, the Sands entrance to Encore is not open. You'll have enter through the entrance (Wynn Blvd.) on Las Vegas Blvd. If you have tower suites, you'll see valet right away. If you're a low roller like me, you'll have to drive around and self park.  BTW, there is an Encore entrance at the Wynn parking lot, but that is also closed. Unlike the Wynn, the room here seems spacier but just by a tad. The 2 bed here are more like Queens unlike the Doubles at the Wynn.  And like the Wynn, the beds are are the firm side and your room comes with a tube of sanitizer, two wipes, and two masks.  I had a lovely half view of Trump hotel and the unfinished view of resort world. (Enter Sarcasm Here) and the other half view of strip hotels like Palazzo and Venetian.If you don't have a mask, or forgot on the way down, they're complimentary for the disposable ones by security next to the entrance of the hotel elevators. As for the pool here, they will scan your hotel room key to see if it's active upon entry.  No reservations needed, but first come first served. The Saturday we went in late July, it wasn't crowded in late afternoon. They even set up lounge chairs at a covered restaurant patio for shade. However, they did only have 1 pool open. We ended up walking to Wynn pool passing through the shops, about 15 minute walk.Much of the restaurants are open via reservation only.  The hotel will send your phone a text during your stay once checked in. You can then make a reservation through your phone. I never tried, so I can't elaborate more than this. One thing about this place which is a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it is you can't get decent cell service here. Spotty at best with the data.  After comparing, I would say it was a tad better at Encore than at the Wynn. Then again, we stayed on the 60th floor at the Wynn facing the golf course. Perhaps that's why we couldn't get reception? Not sure. I love the Wynn and Encore and just heard today that Le Reve production is no more. Also sad to hear that layoffs are coming for some employees here in upcoming weeks.  Wynn had kept the whole staff on payroll during it's shutdown, totally classy but I can understanding the dynamics of the business side. If you're on the fence of coming to Vegas, the Encore or the Wynn is the place to go to ease your mind. Everything is done in an orderly fashion. Everyone is body scanned for temp upon entry. Every transaction is sanitized afterwards during check-in. I can't say much about table games, I don't play anymore but there are partitions now on the games and slot machines are distant apart. Even the bathroom stalls are distant, depending on where you go. I still have not seen the Wynn cats here, I will keep coming back until I do! But in the mean time, you should consider coming here because it's one of the most comfortable hotels on the strip with the utmost hospitality."
Encore,Yelp,"This is a 5 star hotel and felt like it. The lobby is beautiful and the staff are so nice and helpful. Our room was giant and on the 37th floor with perfect views of the mountains. There is lots of technology in here. There is an Alexa to control all sorts of things, just ask ,A tablet that controls lights and blinds and tv, tvs in bathroom and room and lots of spots to charge. The remote drape thing was a huge hit with both of us. They opened as you entered the room so it felt special. The beds are so nice and sumptuous, I never wanted to leave. The bathroom was pretty and had 2 nice soft robes.   The casino is large and well staffed. There are tons of beautiful restaurants. It connects with the Wynn down a nice hallway so you can use all their facilities also, including their pools. 2 very pretty pools with lots of seating, both covered and not. The fresh flowers everywhere were gorgeous. I will stay here again."
Encore,Yelp,"Encore was our destination for the third leg of our three-night road trip, and, as expected, it did not disappoint except for some of the COVID procedures and policies.  Our room on the 54th floor with a great view of the strip was palatial and easily the nicest hotel room either of us have stayed in.  Encore's COVID procedures were similar to other Vegas strip properties, such as mask wearing requirements, plexiglass barriers, temperature checks at the entrances, and extra cleaning going on more or less constantly.  Two COVID procedures did rub me the wrong way, hence the one-star reduction from my previous five-star review:  (1) The mini bars were taken out of service.  This meant that if you wanted something that would ordinarily be found in the mini bar, such as a diet coke, water, beer, or whatever, you had to order those items from room service.  We didn't avail ourselves of this.  Who wants to deal with the wait and then have to tip on top of the high room service prices?  Encore tried to put a happy spin on this by calling it ""The mini bar that comes to you!""  Nice try.  I've stayed at Bellagio and Palazzo recently during COVID, and neither took their mini bars out of service.  (2) The glasses in room were replaced by incredibly fragile plastic cups.  The first one I tried to remove from its packaging broke more or less immediately.  At this price point, the Encore should have supplied real glasses.  We stayed at the Bellagio for the first leg of trip, and our room had real glasses, so I know Encore could have supplied real glasses."
Encore,Yelp,"I gotta give Steve Wynn his props.  Golden Nugget, Mirage, Bellagio, Wynn, Encore.  He built each of those properties, and each of them raised the bar in Vegas.  Like it's sister property (The Wynn), Encore is a very nice, easy place to stay in Vegas.  The accommodations and service are top notch, and it's a beautiful, easy to navigate property.  I can't say which of the two properties I prefer, and it's a little tough to describe how the two properties differ from one another even through they are far from identical to one another.  I would say Encore has a more sedate feel to it overall. My sense is it does not get as many people wandering in from Las Vegas Boulevard as the Wynn.   Although, like the Wynn, the Encore is a thoroughly modern Vegas hotel, it retains a lot of old Vegas feel to it in terms of scale and service.  Genuinely great service used to be a given in Vegas almost anywhere you went, but it's become increasingly rare.  I miss the old Vegas a lot, and the Wynn reminds me of the old Vegas even if it doesn't really look like the old Vegas.  Our room was perhaps the nicest room we've stayed in in Vegas.  It was effectively a junior suite with a good sized sitting area adjacent to the bedroom area.  This room seemed larger than it's equivalent at the Wynn, but it might just be a different layout that seems larger.  There are three nice sized pools on the property.  Two are for hotel guests only, and are about what you would expect for a luxury hotel in Vegas, which is to say they are very nice.  The third pool, Encore Beach Club, is open to anyone 21 and up willing to pay the entrance fee.  Think Rehab, Ditch Fridays, etc.  I think building a dedicated day club pool is a great idea.  It eliminates what would otherwise be an annoyance to guests who aren't down with the Bro's and Ho's pool scene (pretty much anyone over the age 30).  Parking is a breeze unlike many Vegas properties.  The parking structure is easy to get in and out of and easy to park i, and the walk from the parking structure to the casino is basically nothing.  If it's gambling, high end shopping, dinning, or nightlife you're after, Mr. Wynn's got you and your $$$$ covered sun up to sun up, basically, when you consider the late night club scene.  One gripe:  When the pools close at 7:00, the staff could have been a little more diplomatic when telling people they must leave the ""regular"" pool area.  After three loudspeaker announcements, no one needs to be barked at while whey are leaving.  Don't treat hotel guests the same way I imagine you treat some of the Beach Club clientele, mkay?  On a separate occasion, when my buddy was near the Beach Club, which you walk past to get to Las Vegas Boulevard,  a staffer asked him curtly, ""can I help you?,"" when his tone suggested he really meant, ""what are you doing here?"" I would have replied, ""Yes, a cold bottle of water would be nice, thank you.""  Notwithstanding the somewhat less than diplomatic approach to closing the pool, I doubt anyone would be disappointed staying at Encore. Bonus:  Tacos El Gordo is a short walk up the boulevard away.  The spicy pork tacos there are spectacular and worth the short walk up the boulevard to an admittedly somewhat rough around the edges shopping center in the shadow of Encore to get them.  The vast majority of the denizens of Encore will never make that walk and will never know what they are missing."
Encore,Yelp,"Scored a fantastic deal on a King Suite with an amazing view at the Encore via Chase LRHC. The whole experience was fantastic.Encore/Wynn have implemented very impressive safeguards to protect its guests from COVID-19, non-invasive temperature checks, masks, hand sanitizer stations, protective barriers at table games, and proper spacing at the slot machines. Staff clearly explain mask policy at restaurants and in the pool areas, and even better enforce them. Everything was immaculate during our stay, staff constantly cleaning around the casino floor and in the pool area. Had a great time"
Encore,Yelp,"First and last time staying here at Encore. We, a couple who wanted to getaway for a foodie and relaxing trip, did not enjoy our stay here because the walls are PAPER THIN. We kept hearing our neighbors blast obnoxious (bad hip hop and cheesy rock) music and hosting parties?! Every single day, multiple times throughout, we listened to a party from either the left or right side neighbor. I thought that they had a 50% capacity??? If so, then why cram your guests so closely in one area? Maybe give everyone some space and leave an empty room in between. We were staying on the 58th floor so pretty high up so it wasn't coming from the hotel lobby...I hear voices and talking from the other rooms as well as the hallway. I had to sleep with ear plugs in because it was unbearable at night time. Guess what, the earplugs they gave me were awful. Cheap and oversized ones that hurt my ears even more. The noise problem is not as bad anywhere else on the strip and I have stayed at many other resorts. I regret our decision to stay here. Maybe should have picked the Wynn side instead. It got so bad one day at around 3-5pm that I had to call front desk, twice, about party noise nuisance. They ended up finally sending a security and manager up and we could hear them banging on the guest's door and nobody answered for like 5 minutes. Then they finally opened and it escalated into a loud confrontation and ugh, it was so ratchet it felt like we were staying at Circus Circus. I wasn't sure if it was going to result in violence, but it was scary and so we decided to leave our room and go to the gym for a workout. The gym was nice, it is small but well stocked, near the zen-like spa area. Wish I could say that our room was this calming and relaxing!We've seen a lot of younger folks come and go and to me, this doesn't seem like a high class 5 stars hotel. This seems more like a 3 stars hotel. Pros: Ok, I did enjoyed our panoramic window views, half city and half pool. The electronic touchscreen by the bed to control the lights, temp, and automatic blinds was a really cool feature. The 360 rotational tv stand was clever. The bed was comfy and I liked the down pillows. The elevator is quick and takes you up and down impressively fast. Our room was spacious and we enjoyed the great dining options in the Wynn ecosystem. Fun vibes in the lobby. Negative one star for not having a coffee bar! What the hell... The dopest 5 stars places offer a Nespresso machine and even Holiday Inn has a coffee machine. Imagine having to wake up and walk a journey through crowds and wait in a line to get a cup of coffee. Yeah, it isn't great. No complimentary water bottles either. The mini bar wasn't even property packed and for a bottle of water I had to call them to bring me one and they charged me $9 for a ""delivery fee."" I only found out when I was signing for it. I was pretty livid as you can imagine, lol.This review is for the entire experience of staying in our room for 3 nights and minus the dining options... Poor experience. I will never come back here again for lodging. I will come here again for the restaurants and entertainment but even if I had a free room offer, I wouldn't stay. The walls are poorly insulated and I just hear non-stop parties and loud music. What are we, a college dormitory? No coffee or tea in the room and the vibes here feels too young, like 20-yo young. I say save your money and stay somewhere else (anywhere else would be better) then walk over here for dining, gaming, and socializing."
Encore,Yelp,This is definitely one of the higher end places in Vegas to stay. The room is what you would get for the price you would expect to stay at here. Mostly everything was clean (especially with covid) and they were adhering to social distancing guidelines. I found one pillow here in the room we stayed at that had some odd food looking stains on them so I threw that to the ground and ordered a new pillow be sent up. My GF also asked the front desk for other toiletry items that were promptly brought up. The room itself is Alexa enabled so we were able to voice command things like the lights and curtains. The staff on this side of the hotel were also more accommodating compared to the Wynn side of the hotel (some of the staff there were not too nice at all).
Encore,Yelp,"Welcome to the Encore State Penitentiary!COVID precautious are fine, and our Tower Suite room was decent...BUT they've started searching guests with metal detector wands and going through your bags at entrances.  There are also random K-9 security dog patrols on the ground floor areas.  Massive step down in the experience of staying at a supposed luxury hotel.Crossing the Wynn/Encore off the list and planning for the Bellagio next time.  You generally put up with being searched at dive bars, but not at any decent hotel."
Encore,Yelp,"Last month, we got to stay at the Encore Hotel and we booked it through the Fine Hotels and Resorts program through our Amex Platinum Card. We booked it through Amex because there are a bunch of benefits that we wanted to use so I wanted to share with everyone on what we got. You can read the full review here...  theluxurylowdown.com/enc…1) Daily Breakfast for Two: The daily breakfast was pretty generous. We got $40/person for two people so $80 total to spend at select locations at either the Encore or Wynn. 2) Room Upgrade: We ended up booking an Encore Resort Two Queens room since there were four of us. We did get upgraded to a panoramic view, but the room still pretty much looked the same.3) Noon Check-In: We ended up being able to check in by 11:30 a.m.4) 4:00 p.m. Check-Out: Unfortunately, we did not use it since our flight was at 11:15 a.m.5) Complimentary Wifi: I've always found this perk odd since all wifi is pretty much included in the resort fee that you always have to pay. Surprisingly, this time around, they gave us a $5 credit for the wifi. Not sure if this is a new perk with Amex or if it was just for this hotel, but I'll definitely update once I find out.6) Unique Amenity ($100 spa credit): The spa at the Encore is open, but none of the amenity spaces are. So you can't use the lockers, jacuzzis, sauna, spa, lounges, etc. You only come to get your massage and then you leave. I ended up booking a 50-min custom massage, which was $170. Regarding COVID, everyone is required to wear a mask and your temperate will be checked at the entrance. The casino was not crowded and there was a lot of room compared to other hotels we've stay at. We felt safe and our time was very enjoyable there!"
Encore,Yelp,Amazing experience! I wish I could stay here for a month. The room was very luxurious and clean. Lots of high end shops and restaurants.
Encore,Yelp,"Encore is a beautiful property and resort but it isn't perfect when compared to other 5 Star resorts on the strip.Enjoyed my stay here over the weekend for a family reunion.  My family was spread out between a few different floors.  I enjoyed the view as well as the comfort of the room which was expected and why I chose to stay here and have for many years.My only issue is that my ""Non-Smoking"" Room and floor smelled like weed.  Which wouldn't be a problem if my guest didn't have asthma.  I mentioned this to the hotel and requested a room change but was told that they were not able to do anything as they were fully booked.  This was unacceptable and I was surprised at the response.  I was told to discuss it with Guest Relations which I did.  So I'm currently awaiting an answer to date.  Another issue is that the checkout feature on the TV didn't work when I tried.  Which is an inconvenience. You have to wait in line at the lobby or wait on the phone and hope someone answers.  I've never experienced this before at other resorts...Since the departure of Steve Wynn, I've noticed a few things here and there have slid from what I've been accustomed to and for the worst.I hope Management works to keep their loyal customers happy and returning.  I've provided them with lots of business in terms of dining, gaming and shows.  For over a decade I've had nothing but good things to say and have recommended their properties to my family and friends. I'd hate to have to look elsewhere and steer them as well. Make it right Encore/Wynn. Thank you in advance."
Encore,Yelp,"Received another VIP Invite and plan on visiting soon. This time around it's more than just a birthday trip for my wife... it's now an inaugural trip for my newborn son.Looking to share the experience of bright lights and luxury in our suite!It's been a while and I'm definitely looking forward to it.The ease of booking online and on their app makes it easier and accessible to reserve a room, dinner and show reservations.Counting down the days!Vegas Baby!"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"Great Covid-19 safety measures in place!My bf and I have stayed at the Venetian (in the Venetian tower) before and loved it.  This time, we stayed in the Palazzo tower on the 50th floor, the Paiza Club level.  The suite was amazing.  It had a large living room, 2 restrooms, a bedroom, vanity area, and a large walk-in closet.  It was 2000 square feet and housed a piano, 5 televisions, a jacuzzi tub, and pool table.  The automated window coverings were a nice touch.  Being the highest floor in the state of Nevada, the view was spectacular.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, we felt very safe.  They seemed to have taken all precautions- plexi-glass everywhere (bathroom sinks, casino tables, etc), every other slot closed off to allow for distancing, masks enforced, elevator capacity limited to 4, hand sanitizer dispensers everywhere, thermal scanning at elevator bays to rooms, people stationed at high touch areas assigned just to wipe down whatever was touched...  Cleanliness throughout the hotel and casino were immaculate.  We were impressed.  The well equipped fitness center was open with limited hours and capacity but capacity was quite large at 45.   Masks were required.  Hand sanitizer and wipe stations were located throughout the center.  The fitness center employee did periodic checks and sanitation sprays of the equipment.  Security to the tower was great.  Security was stationed on the first floor in front of the elevator bay and you needed scan your room card to pass them.  Service was outstanding.  We checked in on the Venetian side with Michael.  Michael was professional, friendly, super personable, down to earth, and helpful.  Other staff we encountered from housekeeping to security were wonderful, too.The Venetian scored itself another 5+ rating for this visit."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"My new favorite hotel in LV.Last minute trip to Las Vegas landed us on the strip at The Venetian.  The bf and I chose this hotel for several reasons.  Every room is a suite!  The fitness center in the hotel is the largest fitness center on the strip.There is no separate fee for use of the gym.The hotel is conveniently located near the middle of the strip. The hotel itself is gorgeous. Our visit was a Saturday to Monday weekend in March.Our split-level suite was clean, comfortable and gorgeous.  I particularly enjoyed the USB ports on the desk and on each bedside, the window coverings, the 3 televisions (1 in the restroom), the view of the strip and beyond from the 31st floor (additional fee), and the simple high end style without being tacky. The fitness center was amazing for a hotel gym.  It was larger and better equipped than most small independently owned gyms boasting a rock wall (separate fee), a little eatery, a huge cardio area with treadmills, bikes, different types of ellipticals and stair machines, a stretching area, strength machine area with state of the art equipment that I had never seen before (and I've been to numerous gyms in several different cities and states), and a free full weight area.  Towel service with both wet and dry towels was also included.  So convenient!  In the past, I would always have to drive to a freestanding off the strip gym if I wanted to get a full workout in.  The only negative we found was that the eatery was out of protein powder on both days the bf wanted a shake. The location of the gym was centrally located for our needs.  We took Uber one day and walked the next.  The upscale hotel was well decorated, clean, and well maintained.  Security separated the rooms from the casino as you must use your keycard to gain entry to the room towers.  The restaurants and shops were all very nice.  We dined at Primeburger for breakfast (see separate yelp review).  There is also a canal and gondola ride which goes through the shop areas to outside the hotel.  Most of the pool areas were closed during our visit and it was windy and cold. We did peek though.  Gorgeous area.  I snapped a photo which is included in this review. Not that anyone sleeps in Vegas but we got some good shut eye as the hotel area was, for the most part, quiet.  I did here some folks stumbling back to their rooms in the hallway at around 4 am.  But no noise from upstairs or kids running through the halls. The bed was also very comfortable.  Service throughout the hotel was outstanding.For a hotel on the LV strip, this hotel earns itself a solid 5... maybe even a 5+."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"This is our first stay here since the pandemic (last trip to Vegas was in March 2020).  First the bad:  currently at least, the crowd in Vegas and at the Venetian is far less upscale than prior to the pandemic.  Sure, no one expects everyone to dress up the way they did in Frank Sinatra's time, but just the way many people dress and act in Vegas right now, including thankfully isolated but increasing incidents of violence on the Strip, is not edifying.Now, is this lower end crowd in the VIP areas and high roller player rooms?  No - so, if you want a high end experience you may still get it, but just seeing the way Vegas has gone downhill is disappointing.As far as our stay, over a week in an almost 2000 square foot suite on the top floor with its own exercise room and wet sauna, what's not to like?  Even the standard rooms at the Venetian are large compared to what other Vegas resorts offer (standard room at Venetian - 650 sq. ft., on par with the 745 sq. ft. standard rooms at Encore), so as far as accommodations, Venetian is high up there in Vegas rank.We were here more to relax than gamble. The shower steams have been removed from all of the suites, but ours had a fantastic cedar wet sauna that got as hot as you would want it to be.A lot of the furniture in the Venetian rooms is genuine Drexel Heritage or the like, solid wood, not like the particle board stuff you will find at most every other hotel.  An update to the carpet, which is starting to show its age, might be in order.Service seems a bit slower these days as perhaps the hotel is understaffed, but everything is taken care of well, and safely.  Everything in the room is clearly sanitized (even glasses come shrink wrapped), and room service is available with contactless delivery at the door.  All the restaurants are open, although some have limited hours and days.Thankfully, paper menus (for room service) remain in the room- it's hard to navigate some of these online only (via the television) order systems.Although housekeeping is trying to stay out of rooms when guests are inside, we had no problem with having our staff clean while we were there.  It helped that we were in a suite, we'd just stay in one side while they worked the other.  Staff always wore gloves and masks, and we kept our masks on whenever interacting with anyone.Masks are thankfully mandatory everywhere, although you will find a few trying to skirt the regulations here and there, such as in the Canyon Ranch gym which is definitely the largest and best equipped hotel gym I have experienced anywhere in the world - complete with everything from free weights, to the latest Technogym strength conditioning equipment, TRX straps and even a forty foot climbing wall.  Generally the people whom you see trying to take their masks off or slip them down around their chins are part of the same lower end crowd that has infiltrated Vegas in general of late. No smoking at any of the table games, although smoking is still allowed elsewhere in the casino.  The movement towards no smoking casinos has begun!The Venetian has seven pools, and the next door Palazzo has eleven.  The Canyon Ranch spa's wet areas (steam, sauna, all communal rooms) are closed during the pandemic, so there is no point to a day pass, but spa treatments such as massages and skin care are still available.Valet is now open again, although with the long wait at times to get a valet, you might be better off just dropping off your bags with the bellman if you have a lot of luggage, and then self parking.  Venetian's parking remains free for everyone.If you are looking for a getaway, whether to gamble or just relax, Venetian is still one of the best and most luxurious spots on the strip.  Just be careful out there - especially at night."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"I still give the Venetian five stars (be sure to read my prior review), although there are a couple of changes here for the worse.This experience is based on a comp'ed (free) suite and full access to the VIP lounges, which provide you with free drinks and food in a relaxing environment, but even minus the VIP lounge even if we had been paying for our large suite, still I would give the Venetian four stars.  Our suite was just as beautiful and spacious as the ones I stayed in since the place opened, quiet, elegant, with real solid wood furniture (not the particle board or low pressure melamine you'll find at the Bellagio).  At the Venetian even the standard rooms are like mini suites, coming in at 650 square feet.  The larger suites have a separate bedroom with a canopied bed, dining table and large living room, steam room or sauna, some have exercise areas, some have surround sound equipped screening rooms.The hotel is generally quiet although if someone is blasting the stereo in the largest suites (I have done that myself), the adjoining rooms will be far from quiet.The casino is spacious and beautiful, with plenty of gaming tables including multiple Baccarat tables, plus slots, at both the Venetian and Palazzo sides.  The crowd is upscale - no one walking around with no shirt on, like you might see at the Cosmopolitan.  The restaurants at the Venetian are top notch.  This time we experienced AquaKnox (see my separate review).The Canal Shops and the adjoining Palazzo shops are beautiful, and many are very high end.  You may ride a gondola through the Canal Shops.One thing new, are the explosive sniffing dogs that patrol the entire resort.  Apparently these have been around for years, but never noticed them before, so they must have stepped up the patrols.There are two current negatives which is why the downgrade:1) The swimming pools are closed on the Venetian side, until about May 2019, and there is heavy, heavy construction sound that will pierce right through the windows into your room if you are unlucky enough to get a room on that side of the casino above the construction.Owner Sheldon Adelson has never cared about peace and quiet for his guests if he needs to get busy with forward construction.  There are periods I have stayed at the hotel where noisy construction has gone on 24 hours a day 7 days a week.  Right now, the pool construction happens 9am to 9pm daily, and is noisy even in a top floor suite on the 36th floor. Currently, just be sure to get a room on the opposite of the hotel, not overlooking the Venetian pool construction, or live with noise all day long.  Be sure to ask about ANY construction going on - because there always seems to be something - and pick a room away from the commotion.Also, because the Venetian pools are currently closed, you must walk all the way through the Venetian and past the Venetian side spa check in and to the Palazzo to use their pools.  It is practically a two day horse ride all the way from your Venetian room to that Palazzo pool.2) The second negative is that now that there is a mandatory $45. daily resort fee (pays for WiFi, free parking, free use of the gym, among other hotel ""costs""), the gym at the Venetian, which is actually the largest and nicest one I have ever seen at any hotel (including free weights and the latest strength conditioning equipment, plus cardio machines and rock climbing wall), tends to get crowded.  Now that hotel guests are paying for it, they figure they might as well use it.   Before, when it cost $30. per day to use the gym, it was beautifully empty.It used to be that the $30. got you the gym and the spa - now the gym is included in the daily resort fee, and the spa itself (which is now on the Palazzo side) is separate and costs anywhere from 32 - 50 per day, although the spa is free for that day with purchase of any 50. or higher service.Still, these negatives aside, the Venetian provides world class service and amenities.  You will feel pampered and refreshed after each night in the hotel (as long as you pick a room away from construction noise)."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"I used to stay at this hotel every few weeks, and always on the 35th floor in their Renaissance suites in the original tower.  However, those were in my gambling days when everything was comped (free room, free food, known as ""RFB"" in casino parlance).  The Renaissance Suites are 1980 square feet, and all feature a separate bedroom with a King sized canopied bed, and a living/dining room with a six chair table.  It is fabulously quiet and restful in that bed in their suite bedrooms.  In the large marble floored bathrooms, you will find either a dry sauna or steam room, and layouts include either an exercise area (with a treadmill, elliptical or stationary bike) or a large screen television viewing room with a very loud surround sound stereo system that will get complaints from neighbors if you play it too loud.However even the regular rooms at the Venetian are nice, semi-suites, and 650 square feet, with a separated by balcony lining step down into living area and step up into bedroom floor plan.The Venetian has finally updated all of their rooms to down comforters - in the beginning years it was all Vellux blankets.All of the Venetian rooms feature Drexel Heritage real solid wood furniture.  By way of comparison, at the Bellagio it's all particle board / low pressure melamine plastic furniture that looks nice but is not solid.The Venetian is located directly across from T.I. (Treasure Island) and is centrally located on the strip.  You may cross to T.I. across a suspension bridge over Las Vegas Boulevard.  The Venetian has the Canyon Ranch Spa, all 134,000 square feet of it, which includes the only gym in a Las Vegas hotel that includes complete free weights - bench, bars, dumbbells, and the usual steam/sauna/jacuzzi that you will find in the spas of all premium Vegas resorts.  The gym at the Canyon Ranch Spa is on the level of a 24 Hour Fitness Super Sport, as far as equipment.  It is far above the typical hotel gym.  The spa is world class too, with massages and all sorts of treatments offered.The Venetian features multiple swimming pools, amid a five acre environment.The Grand Canal Shops on the Venetian side, and The Shoppes at the adjoining Palazzo resort/hotel provide high end restaurants and shops, including some of the top designers (for Louis Vuitton though you'll have to go to the Wynn, Caesar's or the Shops at Crystals at the MGM CityCenter).  Barney's of New York is here.  Madame Tussaud's.You may ride a gondola down the Canals.My favorite restaurant at the Venetian is Delmonico Steakhouse (the bone in ribeye is not to be missed).  I've eaten numerous times at Zeffirino too, which is good, but not in my opinion on the level of Delmonico.  Two of the restaurants I used to frequent and liked are now closed, DB Brasserie, and Pinot Brasserie.  I guess they have it in for the brasseries.Tao Nightclub, Tao Beach, Lipshtick comedy show - all here.The Venetian (along with the Palazzo) feature a combined 120,000 square foot casino.  If you are a Baccarat player, as I was, you'll love its high end Baccarat room which features multiple grand and midi Bacc tables open simultaneously, which is key to winning at Baccarat because you may move to a different table when the shoe goes sour and unpredictable.  There are private salon rooms for the ultra high end players.  As far as action, the high end tables are all $100. minimum, and for the most part you'll need to pony up $25. minimum to play blackjack, mini Baccarat or craps at most any table game at the Venetian.  The slots are the same as at any casino.  The blackjack isn't the greatest odds, do you research to find the lowest house edge in Vegas because where to find the best odds blackjack table changes constantly.  The Venetian does a great job too of hiring attractive cocktail waitresses and putting them in skimpy outfits, which let's face it, adds to the allure of any casino.  Dealers, pit bosses and casino hosts are all friendly too.You will need to play pretty high end in their casino to get anything free, but this is pretty much the same at any top resort on the strip.The vibe at the Venetian is upscale, but not necessarily older.  All ages.In all, a fabulous world class resort.  One downside I would comment on, and this stems from the inevitability of being a huge sized hotel, is that it is practically a two day horse ride from the check in lobby or VIP check in, to your room - down the grand foyer hall through the casino and up the elevators.  It's basically just a long walk to get from your room to anywhere else.  Occasionally, your electronic room key will stop working and you will be faced with either that trek back to the lobby or VIP area, or a twenty minute wait sitting in the carpeted hall for security to get to you with a new key.The parking garage gets about as hot as hell must be in the summers.  However, as of this writing neither Venetian nor Palazzo charges anyone anything for parking."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"Although I had been to The Venetian several times since it opened in May 1999, this summer was my first time spending two nights in the Venice of Vegas. This would be the latest chapter of my pages of visits in The Venetian.   I love themed resorts. The Venetian does a spectacular job with the theme. Over and over, no matter how many times I visit what is part of the second largest resort complex in the world, the attention the theme blows me away. The theme itself has all the elements of a Las Vegas show. The resort features two canals with singing gondola boats, St. Mark's Square, the Rialto Bridge, the Lion of Venice Column, and the Clock Tower amongst numerous landmarks. If I never stayed in the hotel the well done Venice theme this review would be a 4 star rating based on my visits.   What I also love themed resorts that provide complimentary parking. They never jumped on the pay to park bandwagon.    Spending a couple of nights in the Venetian has always been on my Vegas Bucket List. Recently an Essential Workers special wiped it off my list. They offered a Buy One Get A Night Free special where a suite was around $200 for two nights.   We stayed in Room 23231 in the Venetian Tower. The check-in experience is an elegant experience. The hallway leading to the desk is under a ceiling of paintings. This speaks, ""Elegant first impression."" Closer to the desk is the Armillary Sphere sculpture. At the Venetian real human beings greet the guests at the desk. From the check-in the Venetian Tower is across the well-lit exciting casino. Their is a security guard by the elevator bank. Guests are required to swipe their key card. The safety aspects extend to Covid-19 precautions. Upon entering the property, Security provides a temperature check. There is a Covid-19 ppe package on the desk.    The suite as expected was out of this world. It wasn't the world that the floor to ceiling window overlooked. It was a breathtaking view from the pool deck across Treasure Island to Red Rock Canyon. Late at night with the lights off I spent several minutes in solitude taking in this view with a Bud Ice. The photos below are picture descriptions of the room.    The Bud Ice brings up the subject of alcohol. Years ago back in 2009, I had the best Spicy Bloody Mary ever in the center casino bar. On this staycation I utilized the Walgreens downstairs for my alcohol needs.    When it came to my food needs, the Venetian did not disappoint. We made use of the Grand Lux Cafe. The stuff you hear about Vegas being a 24 hour city is overrated. This restaurant is one of the few that are currently open til the late night hours. They serve great food at reasonable prices. Throughout the Venetian and connected Palazzo there are several restaurants from the fast casual Panda Express to Yard bird.   When it comes to shopping the Venetian had the bases covered with the Grand Canal Shoppes. This mall follows the Venetian theme to the ""T."" It is a Venetian Disneyesque themed mall with gondolas, living statues, a Wishing Tree, St. Marks Square, paintings, and much more. I plan to review it in the future.    It wasn't in the luxurious suite, exciting casino, or restaurant that I had the most enjoyable time. A nice thing about the Venetian amungst so many others is that it shares facilities with the Palazzo. The upshot was that in the middle of the summer there was sufficient room to social distance in the clean and picturesque pool decks.    The Venetian was literally built on entertainment. You see, prior to 1997 it was The Sands. This is the iconic hotel where the Legendary Rat Pack performed. Today the Sands name lives on in the attached Convention Center complex and company name. A lot has changed since the Rat Pack. Next year the state of the art The Sphere is expected to be complete in the back of the resort. There are currently a few theaters on the property. As I stated earlier, my entertainment of choice here is taking in the Venice theme.    My brother and I had such a marvelous time staying here that over the course of the summer, we'd do three staycations at three other Strip properties. When I continue to visit the Venetian, I cannot help but look forward to another staycation in the Venice of Vegas."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"We were there in what would be the offseason.  As in we stopped in in 2020.  That means that we were treated extra kingly and had an incredibly good rate, as the hotel was no where near capacity.We weren't going to Vegas but we were road-tripping through the area and thought, why not?The rates were great and there was a lot of other options but we settled on the Venetian.  Check in was easy as could be.  Again, probably because there was so few guests.There was safety and cleanliness policies everywhere as we worked our way to the room.When we entered I still expected it to be an extra small room based on the low rate we got.  But the room was ginormous!it was one of those room that had sort of 2 different floors and rooms.  Not to mention it had one of those bathrooms inside a bathroom!  It felt very clean and was overall quite beautiful.  We layed back on the bed testing it out.  It was luxurious feeling.  It was a long walk from the front desk but as far as complaints go that's nothing as that's pretty common in Vegas as I understand.  We may mix it up and try another place if we ever go back, but the Venetian was aces in my book."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,So I usually LOVE this place but they are FAILING and not making me feel very safe in this time of the pandemic.  Not only are there some spots on the floor and other areas in the room - which can be taken care of by ordering a pair of slippers. BUT HERE IS THE FAIL: my honey went to take a shower this morning and found hair in the shower wall and floor and soap spots or streaks on the shower walls. He asked me for the floor mat but that also looked dirty. IF you are claiming the highest cleaning standards then make sure you meet them. I've been a hard sale to get me to go stay anywhere but my own house and my honeys birthday is this weekend so we wanted to do something and finally get away! I already have a weird issue with showers and this is making it hard for me to take one! Someone else's hair and goo was left in the shower in plain view! So what else was not cleaned properly. The property is gorgeous and gambling was great last night but really come on and live up to the standard that you sell. Now to call the front desk....
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"This is the best hotel I've ever stayed in. The attention to detail. They take your temperature when entering, you see staff sanitize often, mask and sanitizer is provided. Came for a birthday and had out room floor ""upgraded"" to a higher floor. Pools are opened until 6, many restaurants. There is a mall within the hotel. You can ride the gondola from inside as well as outside of the hotel. They also offer late check out for 1pm. Security is great as you require a room key to enter certain areas of the hotel. It's less than 10 mins from the airport"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"Note: Food at Grand Lux Cafe This is more important than food. Trust the universe. This was my last night in Vegas and I had a good week in poker heading in to this night 7-2 and +$2k. Nothing crazy but better than most who hit Vegas. I had a decision to make on this last night: Sahara Poker Room for cash game or Venetian Poker Room for $125 tourney and then cash game. I was staying at Sahara and walked downstairs to poker room. I saw a seat open and approached, but there were chips and a drink in that spot--he must have went to bathroom or to make a phone call. So, I took an Uber to Venetian. I needed to Uber because on my first night there when waking in no man's land a car pulled up with a couple in it and the woman asked, ""Are you working or walking?"" Despite a rough first night at the table, I said, ""Walking"" and the car tore off. On this last night, not only did I get an Uber but it ended up being an ex-Poker player who knew a lot of same people. We talked and became friends. And when I hit the tourney, it turned out two players at my table knew me--one from Cherokee and one from Tunica. That was cool! One of those players 3-bet jammed on me when I had TT. Despite knowing he had AA or KK, I called. My gut told me it was the correct life decision, but I didn't know why. He had KK and and I busted, losing $150. But....On the very first hand of the cash game I had TT (again) and hit the High Hand for $600 (tipped $50, which is double the norm). I finished that session +$1179.This led me to a very late dinner, where the service was incredible; the atmosphere was excellent; the salad and bread were good; and the burger made feel not right. I couldn't eat 15% of the burger. Don't know why. They took it off bill and I apologized. I think they appreciated my friendliness--I always give what I get. Forget the burger and focus on the path. By trusting my gut (a good energy), I left Sahara, made a new friend, went back to Sahara with $1179; and ate good bread, salad, and fries. This might not sound like much, but if I didn't listen to that good energy, I could have ended up being scooped up by psychotic nymphos and left in a dumpster behind The Orleans. Just sayin'!"

The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"We've stayed at Palazzo a few times and due to Covid, Palazzo wing was closed for efficiency and lack of bookings which allowed us to stay at Venetian. Our Venetian stay this past weekend was equally as good. I still prefer Palazzo as the new wing was remodeled and has absolutely zero scent of smoke/cigarettes and is really just plush! To our surprise Venetian didn't have the scent either! Important to us as we have kids.Vegas is definitely not a place we take our kids to often but with family and friends living in Vegas, we bring them and let them eat the different restaurants and spoil them pool side when we can. Venetian is a great place to book. Many shops, restaurants and gondola rides to enjoy for a couple days not to mention the exceptional art work on the establishment. It's a must see if you haven't seen it before.All rooms are suites and are very spacious! Set up is identical to Palazzo wing from what I can tell. Might have a slightly different color palette but just as nice.With covid, they give you a small pack of sanitizers and gloves/2 masks. There is a mini bar with goods for convenience but comes with a charge so be careful.  Have fun! Stay in or out and good luck if you play!!!"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"Great place to stay during covid! Essential workers buy 1 night get 1 night free. Pretty good ventilation system. Didn't really smell too much cigarette smoke as other casinos. Rooms are clean. I like the spacious living space and couch that turns into a bed!! Ice machines are working. I wished they could place hand sanitizers next to the machines so it's more hygienic. However, rooms do provide a zip lock bag with wipes, hand sanitizer, etc. ****dont touch any of the food/drinks they have on the refrig and table unless you wanna pay. Both has sensors on it and charges if anything is removed.*******Since the refrigerator is full of hotels sensor, we can't store any of our own food or drinks****Self Parking is free. Not a too long of a walk to front desk check in from the parking lot. They provide self check in through text. Checking out can be through text too, which they provide a link for. Fast, easy, simple!!"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"Used the essential employee discount.The website is easy to use and called to make sure the pools were open since xovid regulations are always changing.Check in process took a bit, i don't know if we showed up at a sjift change or what, but 6 service representatives with no one in front of them took forever. They kept wiping things down over and over but appeared to drag on longer than necessary to avoid the people in the line. Also, the following morning , I got a fraud alert that someone tried using my credit card for 200$, and seeing as this place was the only time I used that card for a few days, I was pretty pissed off I had to close the account.Got to room, all fine , was nice. The bathroom layout was illogical. You can see the TV from the shower but if you wanted to lay in the tub and watch TV, there was a wall right in view of the TV, unless  you turned around and risk hitting you head in the faucet. Not all the pools were open which defeats the purpose of the whole social distance. There isn't  a 21 and over area so no matter where we went there was rowdy kids every where and playing with super soakers.  I dont care about getting my hair wet but I don't want to be blasted in the head/face and ran into because kids aren't paying attention and their parents are too wasted to care if they were even there.Got to wear a mask the moment you try and lay out to sunbathe, again, separate the chairs, because me standing in the pool without mask or me laying 3 ft away from the water doesn't make a difference.Only convenient thing is that the rooms elevator drops you off by pool area.Didn't eat at the venetian, restaurants menus seem to repeat, thankfully I live here so can drive to wherever.When booking, if the view says strip view, its not gling to happen unless you pay extra, so got a nice view of the AC units.Glad only paid for 1 night,  boyfriend and I checked out early, like 1am early. I don't know if the venetian gained too much hype, but it was a huge let down overall.For being an essential worker and dealing with covid daily at the hospital, i was looking forward to relaxing, i didn't feel that from a 5 star hotel."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"Spent a couple of days at the Venetian- had a blast in spite of COVID!The weekend started off by checking into the Venetian Casino and Hotel.  A lovely lady Christina, has taken care of us.  She did a great job explaining things and couldn't have been nicer!  They ask what seems like the general COVID questions any more.The Venetian is decently large, and can be like a maze if you don't know where you're going.  Christina's directions were spot on, navigating elevators and security checkpoints along the way.  Your room key is critical to getting around certain parts of the building.  At various checkpoints you swipe your room key to let security know you're a guest and supposed to be there.The room was very nice - spacious!  Everything was clean and in order.  This particular room didn't have a refrigerator but did have a minibar and snack bar - be warned (and there are stickers telling you this), not to move or examine the drinks or snacks unless you're willing to buy them!  Pool area, just like everywhere else, has limited capacity.  Get there early, when they hit capacity, they start a wait list to get in.  *be warned, if you leave the pool area you may not be allowed back in due to capacity - Plan ahead!  Pool areas are beautiful.  Bars are all closed, but there were cocktail waitresses taking drink orders.Check out was easier than checking in, and can all be done via their phone app.Great time, great place to stay!"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"Decided to splurge a little for this once in a Blue Moon mini-vacation. Upgraded our room to the Grand Suite..... Beautiful and spacious, but curtain didn't work, room divider was broken, mini-fridge broken, make-up mirror did not work all on our first night. Reported next day, excellent staff member came by to fix everything and replace what could not be repaired. We waited until everything repaired, thus cutting into our precious time. We had 28 people in our party at this very resort and we were practically turned away from every night club unless we paid a hefty fee! If you're gonna charge those high prices, make sure things aren't broken. If I could suggest something, it would be to have bathrobe hangers or towel racks or something to hang things, ie; wet towels, bathrobes, etc."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"If you care about coronavirus, read onwards. I did a weeklong stay in Vegas recently. First did Venetian, and then Mirage. I stayed at their better suites for a fair comparison, did alot of walking around. Venetian is consistently thorough with cleaning, social distancing enforcement, and providing masks at both the Venetian and Palazzo hotels and casinos. I made multiple trips up and down the elevators and escalators as I perused the shops, grabbed snacks, gambled, drank, etc. Both Venetian and Palazzo maintained a high integrity of cleanliness. As soon as you left an escalator, an employee would come by and clean. As you're walking up to an elevator, an employee had just finished spraying and wiping down the area. In room dining provided safe, swift, and courteous service which respected social distancing guidelines. Gambling? They consistently wipe down machines, including the high limit areas, which I particularly love. This is a world different than my experience at the suites in the Mirage.At the Mirage I went an entire stay (4 days) without my mini fridge being stocked up. The air conditioner at my room stayed at 80 degrees for the majority of my stay, despite me letting the front desk know and their attempt to fix it (their fix left the AC at 78 degrees). I never once saw anyone wipe down elevators at my floor (floor E) or where you walk off to get to the casino. The restaurants there did some cleaning down. Only the pool thorougly enforced social distancing. I went to some of the other properties (NYNY, Excalibur, Mandalay Bay) and it's the same story, to be frank. Venetian has handled this pandemic far better than many other hotels out there on the strip, and it's not even close. I know! I walked up and down the strip's hotels! I did 25 miles of walking in a 7 day time period in Las Vegas. I arrived negative and left negative in regards to having COVID19 and am still negative. For those of you who don't want to be extra careful everywhere you go, head to Venetian or Palazzo. They're always wiping everything down so you don't have to worry. Thank you Venetian, for a safe and enjoyable stay. Kudos to the entire team for doing a damn fine job. I noticed!"
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"I had a few months ago given Venetian a less than stellar rating based on how they treated their higher spenders, such as myself. In light of recent offers from the Venetian, I gladly give them a 5 star review for the turnaround in customer experience."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"A wonderful, attentive, and respectful gent named Michael H took my request tonight regarding accommodations at the Venetian. They just reopened as you well know, and not many high spenders have shown up. Those of us who do like to be comped or given lenient rates in exchange for our stay and fattening the coffers. Venetian hasn't learned how to do this. For a locale that literally designs with upscale in mind, its guest accommodation systems leave much to be desired."
The Venetian Las Vegas,Yelp,"*Covid Update*The last time we've stayed here was when Palazzo opened about 12 years ago! All the rooms still looks like they've kept up in good condition. Our couch has seen better days but since we didn't have people over due to Covid, we truly enjoyed this trip in the room. Other notables in the room: one touch blinds and lights, internet connects at about 20MB down with the login of your room info, TV reception works well, shower has great water pressure, housekeeper knocks at your door about 9am. Parking is a plenty here. Valet I believe takes up first four floors and there are Chargepoint EV chargers on level 6. One of them has the clip broken but will work if you pull back. They are offline but currently works. Of course, they have thermal imaging temp check when you walk in from the parking area. They also check your room key when you go to pool, the workout room, and of course your room. Speaking of the workout room, the place opens at 6am and is just down the stairs I believe on level 4. It is one of the best gyms I've ever used but due to covid, everyone MUST wear a mask. And though it is constantly patrolled by the gym admin, not everyone wears it and it does get crowded here at 8am. There is no music, but you'll get a great workout with the amount of equipment they have. We actually have been here in July as well as visitors and a few things have changed. Bouchon is now open, as many of the other restaurants. We still go to the bakery kiosk at the bottom of the elevator for some of their delectable treats.BTW, check in done in a fashionable manner. When we were there at 3pm, we were told only one person can go to the line to check in to avoid overcrowding. All interaction with the person to check in is done across plexi-glass. Also, if you check in online you can skip the line and go to the far one at the end that is significantly shorter. But like us, you can't ask for your room to be changed after you check in online unless you pay for an upgrade. This last visit, we stayed for free as essential workers. Kudos to the hotel! We did stay another night for $150 more and enjoyed relaxation. Lots of restaurants and bars are open. We ended up spending quite a bit of $ at the Dorsey for drinks and the terrific music here. We had to share a table because a party of 1 joined us. (Who we never talked to) which was kind of awkward. Wished they gave us a complimentary dish or something for having a stranger 3 feet away from us.  We also ate at Mott32 (in my previous post) and that was also terrific. I've been a Mlife member for awhile, maybe it's time for a change! Had a terrific mini vacay and with our spending, we hope that Vegas will survive. We just hope those yahoos in the scooters don't exist in the streets anymore!"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"Really disappointing trip here. This once-great bastion of sophistication, neat niche-bars and well... Just being cosmopolitan... Has fallen far and fast. Our strip-view suite was actually very nice, with a great view of the Aria and the MGM, but that's where the superlatives end. Service was universally cold and unfriendly, and reflected a staff that just isn't what they were, say, 5 years ago. Room deals, in an effort to recruit new customers, have dropped some offerings into the double digits, and this has led to a complete loss of exclusivity with the, ahhhhhhhh... clientele.Thursday and Friday nights were marred by mobs of ""disabled"" scooter riders riding wildly throughout the first and second floors of the hotel and casino. I know factually that NONE of them were disabled due to their average age of 25, the fact that I saw them checking in and carrying their own bags, and the fact that one told me ""this is the way to be lit, boyyyy"". Add their aggressive smoking of weed in public (by aggressive I mean blowing smoke on bystanders), and it literally ruined our stay. This is a new, simply sneaky way to get around large casino floors - There are several companies that will drop off these rental g-ma scooters enmasse, to a casino valet area, where their customers pick them up, ride off with boom boxes in the baskets, flip off guests and shirk security. I'm really sad to say, this place has gotten, well, a bit rough. Cheap slots have been moved to the forefront, and tables to the rear. Only a small number of premium guests come here now... What a shame. The high-limit area was clear of players, and it was apparent that the $$$ has fled.To echo a couple of other reviews, anything above the first floor, to include elevators and hallways, smells like weed 24-7. The carpets in the room hallways smell like weed. Absolutely disgusting, and yet another indicator that the once-great Cosmopolitan has turned into a fraternity house / music video shooting location. Room smelled like dog fur as well; front desk offered to move us to a non-suite. Gee, thanks. Really poor experience, and surrounded by people who looked like they weren't buying, eating or even staying at the hotel, with minimal consequences for bad behavior.Not recommended whatsoever; if you're looking for proper treatment and a clean, exclusive facility, it's the Bellagio, Aria or Wynn. Really unfortunate."
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"dailymail.co.uk/news/art…Again, lack of face coverings and no social distancing enforcement in elevators and casino floors.  People like to wear their face coverings just below their mouths like it's a fashion statement.  Good luck with that!"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"Cosmo guest services tried to do the right thing and offered a wraparound fountain view suite to make up for my last stay.  I have to give them kudos for their quick response to my post on Yelp.  Unfortunately, the stay was again a disappointment.  From the moment I entered the room, housekeeping was still in the room cleaning.  That should have been a warning sign.  First, shower door would not close.  Second, a bug made its way to guest bathroom.  Lastly, garbage from neighboring rooms were left outside in the common area from over 24 hours.  Moreover, there was no social distancing enforcement for elevators.  It was very uncomfortable when people crowded the elevators.  I noticed several suites on my floor with large groups of people.  There was a strong smell of marijuana during my entire stay.  I don't recommend staying at Cosmo."
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"I'm always torn between staying at Cosmo and Palazzo.  On this ocassion, I stayed in a Chelsea wraparound suite (rm 3602) at Cosmo.  The location and strip view are spectacular.  However, I was very dissappointed in the lack of detail in  housekeeping and maintenance services.  I found empty bottles, trash bin full under wet bar and used toothbrush in bathroom drawer.  TV remote was dead.  Quite surprising when you think about the Marriott name associated with this property.When it comes to cleanliness, there is no room for error and shortcuts."
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"I understand it's COVID. Everyone's doing their best. But we didn't endure a masked flight to checkin to a dirty hotel room. Upgraded upon arrival to the tune of hundreds of dollars extra only to find what we did. Used masked in chair, used Qtip in hallway outside room. Called down to front desk and got the run around about  changing rooms after a long wait. Went down to the front desk and got the ""stuff like this is bound to happen"" excuse. Got key to new room but had bags in old room...Went back and room still hadn't been cleaned. Elevator down to new room had French fries on the floor. Condition of hotel leaves a lot to be desired for ""luxury"" hotel.To add insult to injury, found roaches climbing up the walls too!!"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"The bf and I kicked off my birthday week in Vegas and our stay exceeded our expectations! We weren't sure what to expect since we were traveling with our dog, but as soon as we entered the hotel, my dog got so much love from the staff and bystanders in the lobby. I will say it was hard to keep distance between people, but the staff were all wearing masks and had a organized system when checking in. I have to give Javier a shout out for showing us great hospitality during Check in! He immediately greeted me Happy Birthday after checking my I.D. and we chatted about our road trip destinations. He even upgraded our room and gave us clear directions on how to arrive hassle free! Thank you so much to the friendly staff and Javier, keep up the great work!!"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"Recently stayed in the Boulevard Tower, closest to the Strip. Perfect. My Studio Terrace Fountain View room with King bed was everything I needed.  Spacious, well-appointed, and the balcony was amazing! So nice to have that extra outdoor space overlooking the Belagio fountains. And who knew there was a hotel in LV where you don't have to walk a 1/2 mile to get to the elevator? Nice!If there was one thing I'd change it would be for the Boulevard Tower to have its own registration/check-in desk.  Having to walk to the far side of the Chelsea building to check-in when I was staying in the Blvd Tower was a bit much.  But that's truly the only thing I would change.  I've found my new favorite Las Vegas hotel!"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"I absolutely love this hotel. The rooms are beautiful, clean and everything feels chic. The best part about my most recent visit was that I got to bring my dog for only an extra $50/night. Compared to other hotels on the strip this was the best deal and the nicest option. I love that almost every room has a terrace. We booked the Terrace suite and opted for the upgrade to Terrace suite with wraparound. Looking back, I would have saved the extra $150 and stuck with our original room because the other part of the terrace overlooked the top of an ugly building. The views of the Bellagio fountains from the main area were exceptional though. My only gripe from this trip was that we were promised a ""bark box"" for our dog upon checkin and I had to call or go to the lobby on three different occasions over the course of 1.5 days just to get the box. Otherwise, they are super gracious to dogs and don't make you feel like a burden. I will definitely return to the cosmo."
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"Cosmopolitan is the place to be in Vegas!!! Very nice hotel, lives up to the 5 star rating!! Room are very clean and spacious. Love the balcony!  Thx to Mayra at check in. Thx for the upgrade!  Cosmo is very COVID-19 clean! U have to try the secret pizza  on the 3 floor"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,In my opinion they should not allowed pets into this Beautiful Lovely hotel?I was disappointed when I saw animals inside the casino floor and so on?Very put off???
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,The place is Amazing! Highly recommend if you can afford it  We upgrade to Fountain View Terence one bedroom   we
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"Just returned from a three night stay at the Cosmopolitan and I could not be more pleased. My terrace studio room was tastefully and elegantly luxurious, something that also applied to the resort as a whole. The interior design is gorgeous and the subtle Alice in Wonderland/adult fairytale theme works very well. A nice bonus is the ability to text ""Rose"", the resort's cyber concierge, when you would like the cleaning staff to make up your room or for other queries. The Boulevard pool is chic and relaxing, but you have to take the elevator to the 3rd floor even though it is located on the 4th. The Chelsea pool looked very alluring also, however it opens later in the morning so I did not visit it. The Wicked Spoon buffet is currently closed. The food court has some great options including Milk Bar (shakes and sweet treats), Eggslut (breakfast sandwiches), and District (Donuts, Vietnamese Coffee, more breakfast sandwiches). Pok Pok wings is worth a visit also. The sports book is big and comfortable with tons of TV screens. The staff are very quick, friendly and professional. The casino is large and amazinglyl smoke-free and minimum bets for card games were in the region of $15-25. Regarding Covid, all staff and guests were wearing masks, and this rule was being politely but firmly enforced all through my stay. Social distancing was encouraged and there was a good number of stations offering hand sanitizer. In conclusion, this is one of the absolute best hotels on the Strip and I would highly recommend it!"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"Not as classy as it used to be, really has a different ambiance now. -Hotel: The room was fine, but it smelled like smoke and weed everywhere. And there was a weird, loud noise next door that kept waking me up. It almost sounded like an elevator running. -Casino: All the machines I sat at were dirty. The casino floor was very crowded, definitely not following COVID safety guidelines. Elevators were packed to the max, no one was following the 4 person rule. Most everyone was wearing their masks improperly, ie. under the chin. No one was enforcing anything. I felt really uncomfortable being in this casino. Very disappointing since the Cosmo is my favorite place to stay and gamble. We visited the Aria, Wynn and Venetian properties to hang out and gamble. They are doing a far better job of following proper protocols and ensuring customer safety and satisfaction."
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"Has anyone ever noticed the beautiful art that's propped throughout the casino!? The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, though smaller in size compared to all other resorts on the Strip makes up for what it's lacking with its style.The color combinations and just the right amount of odd yet uniqueness is what makes this place one of a kind.You get a totally different vibe from this place. I miss it already and can't wait to get back to unwind from all the stresses of having to be holed up at home, working remotely.I just want to immerse myself again in the Japanese Style Bathtub overlooking the strip in my very own Wraparound Suite.I'll definitely be one of the first ones in town to enjoy all its amenities.  The glitz, glamour and all its over the top activities!See you soon Cosmopolitan.Make sure you save my favorite suite and seat at the blackjack table... daddy's got some money to spend!"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"If you've never been to Vegas and plan on visiting - you must consider the Cosmopolitan.Imagine yourself immersed in a bubble bath overlooking the Bellagio Fountains.Or even sipping your favorite drink on the balcony with a Birdseye view of the strip!Vegas is Vegas until you set foot in this property.With dining, gambling and nightlife options that are second to none, this place is the epitome of luxury.You deserve to treat yourself and live once in a while. Take it from me... you'll want to stay and play here! Center strip.In the middle of all the action."
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"After being here several times, I've come to love this hotel and casino. Where else can you play tennis on the strip!? I can't complain when the rooms are free... Can't wait to come back..."
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"If you choose to stay at the Cosmo, be sure to stay in their Lanai Suites overlooking the Bellagio Water Fountains... Probably the best view of the strip and trust me I've been in rooms at Caesars Palace Wynn and Palazzo. This hotel is one of the newest on the strip and it is easy to get in and out of. They have a decent sized casino, an indoor outdoor pool/club(Marquee) and tons of eateries. Even if you never stay here at least give them a visit you'll leave full from all the eye candy... Seriously..."
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"Stay in the Wraparound Suite with the Fountain View! It must be one of the best views on the strip... Seriously! I've stayed in a few of the 5 Star resorts on the strip such as the Palazzo and Wynn and this one is right up there. It isn't huge as the other properties, since it's only on a few acres, but it towers above the rest. Try their buffet, relax in their pool, you won't regret or forget it.  Also, their clubs are the hottest on the strip. They ladies come to grab attention... Can't wait to get back and use my free room offers at the Cosmo!!!"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,"Excellent experience, AMAZING room! I've stayed in most of the higher end resorts on the strip, and Cosmo I'd say is my favorite. It's definitely worth it to at least book the one bedroom suite just for the private terrace and soaking tub. All the staff I encountered were all really awesome, and the dealers at the tables I played at were all GREAT!The only thing is I wish there were like drawers or a dresser to put clothes in. We stayed for 4 nights so it was kind of a pain to always have to dig through my suitcase for all my clothes. Also I do not recall there being a microwave. Also, in addition to the resort fee, keep in mind they hold $150/night incidental fee. There is no way around it, but it gets released as soon as you check out. And yes, pretty much every thing here is expensive, so don't stay here if you are on a budget!"
The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas,Yelp,I booked a room me and my girlfriend lady at the first desk said her mom has to be present because the 21 year old age for the room her mom comes she with us 6 hours later security comes to the door and telling us we have to change rooms but the price value of the rooms where way off so we said we'll just take a refund they say we can't refund u mind u there saying because she not 21 we have to go my point is why book us the room have us spend a 1000 bucks then try to make us switch rooms so as I'm on the phone with the managers see a roach run across the table right when i seen that roach i said i just want to check out and refund me the full amount they said they can't my thing is u can book me a room with roaches but can't refund my money for kick  me out because she's under 21 but her moms standing right here and hers the pic of the rooach if u think I'mLying
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"During COVID lockdown procedures - Went here for a stay vacation and loved it! Checked in on Friday for aone night stray but it was fantastic. As some locals know, there's been a concern for safety on the strip. During my stay, the only way to get to the room is if you had a active room key. Also, asked for a bottle of champagne and balloons to be there when I checked in. Worked out perfect! Now, we had a lot of in room dining service. It took awhile for them to answer, but I'm sure they are working with only a portion of there staff. Huge, clean rooms with a additional security!"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"Great Covid-19 safety measures in place!My bf and I have stayed at the Venetian (in the Venetian tower) before and loved it.  This time, we stayed in the Palazzo tower on the 50th floor, the Paiza Club level.  The suite was amazing.  It had a large living room, 2 restrooms, a bedroom, vanity area, and a large walk-in closet.  It was 2000 square feet and housed a piano, 5 televisions, a jacuzzi tub, and pool table.  The automated window coverings were a nice touch.  Being the highest floor in the state of Nevada, the view was spectacular.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Despite the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, we felt very safe.  They seemed to have taken all precautions- plexi-glass everywhere (bathroom sinks, casino tables, etc), every other slot closed off to allow for distancing, masks enforced, elevator capacity limited to 4, hand sanitizer dispensers everywhere, thermal scanning at elevator bays to rooms, people stationed at high touch areas assigned just to wipe down whatever was touched...  Cleanliness throughout the hotel and casino were immaculate.  We were impressed.  Security to the tower was great.  Security was stationed on the first floor in front of the elevator bay and you needed scan your room card to pass them.  Service was outstanding.  We checked in on the Venetian side with Michael.  Michael was professional, friendly, super personable, down to earth, and helpful.  Other staff we encountered from housekeeping to security were wonderful, too.I highly recommend the Palazzo!"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"I do believe this is the safest spot on the strip for those wishing to venture to Las Vegas and have Covid-19 concerns in mind. From the moment I entered the elevators, there was someone wiping things down. Temp checks upon entry. Workers wiping down escalators. Staff wiping down check-in area. Hand sanitizer stations at the ready. Social distancing enabled room serviceThe staff is to be commended for an exhaustive job well done. 5 star hotel lives up to its reputation."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"There is cleaning everywhere in this hotel. There are machines that temperature check and you need your hotel key to scan past to get to the elevators or the pool, or else they will stop you. I'm surprised that even in October 2020, Las Vegas in general is still very busy and the Strip can get packed at night. They are strict on the face masks which is great! Lots of security everywhere.Some things I wish I knew, but I hope it helps others: Please note that there is a complimentary shelf/counterfor your own personal food items in the ""living room"" underneath the TV. It's about as big as a small microwave space, so I only was able to fit some snacks and some water bottles, laying down, in there. Don't touch the bottom shelf where it has Fiji water or nut packets or you'll get charged.There is a stocked mini fridge but there is a tiny space to fit like a mini food to go container or sandwich at the top, but that's it. There is no coffee machine or tea packets but there is a Starbucks downstairs although they do NOT take the Starbucks app. (TIP: Call nearby Starbucks and ask if they're a corporate one where you can use your app. We found one down the strip.)There is a safe in the closet with an iron and board. The amenities they offer for free is a mini nail file, sewing kit, one makeup pad, and a disposable razor and shaving gel if you request it. On the counter, they now provide disposable face masks, a small bottle of hand sanitizer, and antibacterial wipes.Our phones near the queen beds and office space did not work (stayed on floor 7) but the bathroom phone did work when we called for extra amenities. It's impressive that they greet you by name everytime you call. They do clean you room and make the bed if you request it while you're out. It takes about half an hour which I'm impressed with as well since they spend so much time on it! (We came back early and the cleaning lady said she'll need another 20 minutes.) All in all, I would definitely recommend staying at the Palazzo. My favorite thing about it was the full sized tub which I took MANY bubble baths in!"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"We had an incredible stay at The Palazzo since our last visit in 2019.  We decided last minute to come to LV on our last stop of our honeymoon road trip.  We initially booked at Venetian which is their sister property right next door.  However, the hotel clerk suggested we upgrade to the Palazzo for a better strip view.  Upon arrival, the staff was beyond accomadating.  We were in the long check in line and were prompted to another area for faster service.  The concierge and front desk were exceptional.  Kudos to housekeeping for the immaculate room service.The Palazzo is a chic and modern hotel located at the north end near the Wynn and walking distance to the Fashion Show Mall.  There current health guidelines make you feel safe to stay and play at their casino.  They implement mandatory face masks and gaming tables have a 3-person max with plexi glass barriers.  There are a wide selection of good restaurants: Cut, Lavo, Bouchon and many more.  The Grand Canal Shops are for those who want to spend their winnings on high end designer merchandise.  They recently opened a Boba shop (The Alley) here as well.  The little things that get me excited.The decor is so beautiful with chandeliers all over the casino area.  The hotel has all suite rooms. The rooms are elegant and makes you feel right at home.  The sunken living room is luxurious and comfortable.  The bathroom has a double vanity, powder table, and a soaking tub.  You can even watch TV in there.  The Palazzo is now my favorite place to stay when I'm in Sin City.  Thank you for a wonderful honeymoon experience!"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"It was our first time staying at The Palazzo.  Upon arrival, the front entrance was pretty impressive and elegant.  The valet is complimentary for hotel guests.  The staff are all accommodating.  Except for the concierge who left a sour note for us. The lobby area is decorative.  The architecture is European inspired.  The lunar new year decorations are still on display.  It's a mini version as compared to the Bellagio Conservatory.  We did the mobile check which made it so convenient.  Our room was already assigned before arriving at the hotel.  All you need to do is go to the separate line to pick up your room keys.  We were provided with comp breakfast vouchers.  The rooms are all suites with various amenities.  We requested a city view suite which they provided.  The view was not worth the extra cost.  Our room had the sunken living room and a comfortable king sized bed.  The bathroom was nice with the stand alone shower/tub and a built in vanity table.  For Palazzo standards, the bathroom sink knob should not be broken.  We had to request a maintenance guy.  He was able to repair it in 30 minutes.Besides the minor issue, the hotel suite was super nice. The casino is a bit upscale with table limits of 25-50.  The food options are good and there's a Starbucks on site. I don't know if we want to stay here again. It's secluded at the north end of Las Vegas Blvd."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"Stayed here back in January. Rooms are the same as the Venetian side so love it! Big and clean!This side doesn't really have that many restaurants that open late, you will have to go to the Venetian side for a few late night options."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"So happy were here. We were at Cosmopolitan for 5 days where  a dealer assualted my husband. She denied her action and we had to file a report and had asked to look at the cameras. So follow up was never taken or anything. It was so rowdy over there and a fight broke out during our stay where I saw blood on the floor. Employees there didnt even take any precautions. Alot of people not wearing masks. Here at Palazzo, they take Temperature check,provide complimentary masks everywhere, 4 people max on elevators and people are alot more considerate here. Clean and Classy. We are never disappointed in our stay here."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"Given the current situation with the world, this hotel has done all it can to make sure guest feel safe. From clean bathrooms to making sure all guest wear masks, I felt very safe during my stay at this hotel. I originally had booked for the venetian but I received an invite for a bigger room upgrade with a view at the sister hotel The Palazzo. Is a better option for those who are not ready to be in crowds of people. The Palazzo is quiter, smaller in comparison and the casino is half the size of the venetian making for a much more relaxed environment. The hotel staff at both locations do a good job at following all covid rules. You will however see a few people walk without mask in the hotel, but is expected. Theres no enough staff to follow everyone around and making sure they keep their mask on but overall if they see someone without a mask they will address it. I did see a couple securities who were not exactly fond of enforcing the rule. But it'a okay not too many walking around. The real problem is when you step outside the hotel. No one wears a mask.Because the hotel is smaller and you are staying at one of the luxurious hotels in vegas there is not a lot of cheap eateries. The grand lux cafe located inside will be your cheapest closest option. Not to worry it is good altho not very cheap but the cheapest inside. The venetian does have a bit of a small food court if you dont mind walking to that side. You also have an easy walk to the grand canal shops where there is a much bigger food court with a chipotle and a panda. But due to covid season it closes early at around 7 and of course it is a much longer walk. If your looking for a place to stay while in vegas during corona season and want to feel safe, then this is the place. While some things can be improved such as long wait times for the elevators and possibly no pool access during your stay. The experience is a great one and the rooms here are elegant."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"Yaaaas girl. This place is ah.mazing! We stayed in the king suite executive. 1400 sq ft of luxury. If you are on the fence about spending the extra money, do it! For real. Treat yourself. My husband and I went to Westgate to look around. Girl, ghetto. No, no, no. The smell, the ambiance, all of it so classy at the palazzo."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"Palazzo (5/5) hands down. Housekeeping at Palazzo(2.5/5)So if I am staying for two nights and on the second night I come back to a made up bed, I'm happy. But later that night, I put my hand under the pillow to find the same used tissue I put there the night before.Whomever ""cleaned"" my room did not change the sheets!"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"Stayed here in August during COVID-19 and the property did a great job of remaining clean and sanitary. Multiple check points for temperature to get to certain places, and extra precautions all over the casino to help with social distancing while still enjoying the fun. The rooms were excellent! Large suites with a living area; big bathrooms, and everything was clean and well taken care of."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"I've been to Vegas countless times and this place has the 2nd best room I've ever stayed in. It was a beautiful 800 sq ft room that the staff upgraded us to for my wife's birthday. (Service kudo points to them) location wise, it's still a bit of a walk to a bunch of things but honestly not that bad. Amazing restaurants at this hotel (some of the best on the strip) I would certainly stay here again"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"There is nothing more exhilarating than placing a large bet on your favorite sports team,  your favorite card game or even a max bet on a slot machine - the sheer thrill of the anticipation.  It's a journey of emotional ups and downs. It will leave you either clutching your head in agony in the realization of your loss sets in or alternatively jumping for joy as you come to terms with your unbelievable luck as you look to the heavens in appreciation.  The chasing of this feeling knows no bounds and many people fall victim to this never ending cycle. If you play it right and listen to the gambling genius also known as Kenny Rogers - you'll eventually know when to hold em and when to fold em... or you don't.  Las Vegas to me has been my playground.  You either hate it or love it but I'll admit the casinos know how to take care of their players.  At least they did for me.  Whether I won or lost, I was always invited back with flights, limos, suites, show tickets and endless amounts of liquor and food. Who doesn't love being pampered!? This was all before the financial crisis of 2008.  I remember getting a comped suite at the Palazzo with several grand in cash and free play as well as food! Times were good. I was making a decent living from both work and the stock market... those were the days when casinos were giving out cash like it was going out of style.  I'm glad my gambling addiction is long gone and for the better.  Thanks for the memories though."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"Great place to wine, dine, stay and play.  I try to make it out to Vegas at least once every quarter.  Work hard, play hard.  The staff at the Palazzo and Venetian do things right.  For the last 6 stays, I've enjoyed everything.  You can't beat the location.  My wife loves the shops as well as the spa.  I can't wait to get back."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"I. Pre-planning We originally booked cosmopolitan and determined that it might not be too Covid friendly. We booked at the palazzo for their one bedroom suite 2 queen beds. The price was great for their Covid friendly environment with the suite that we received. The ability to feel at ease at our hotel with a great room type.II. Entrance in to hotelIt is the first expression that matters upon entering the hotel. A. Safety The Palazzo takes Covid seriously from glass separators, free antibacterial, free face masks for guests, and their staff wearing masks and gloves.B. StoresThe stores that normally don't have a sale had sale signs of percentages off on taped on their door. The businesses close earlier. It is worth still shopping at the Venetian stores.C. RestaurantsMost the restaurants had options for reservations or just to walk-in. The preference was reservation to control Covid safety.DAY 1 LunchWe ate at food court and grabbed a cheese pizza with a philly cheese steak sandwich and fries. Food hit the spot for our first eatery in Las Vegas.DinnerWe decided to try the number 1 yelped restaurant in the Venetian called SUSHISAMBA . It's price was $$$. The food wasn't appealing and taste as common as a $ restaurant.  SUSHISAMBA isn't on my first place to eat at anymore. II. RoomsA. Living roomB. Bathrooms Our room is located on the lowest floor 40 as requested.  The one bedroom 2 queen suite has 1-1/2 bath with a TV in the full bathroom. Having 2 toilets makes it easier when you have more than 2 people in the room. The 1/2 bathroom can hear people in the hallway. C. Sleeping AreaNight 1The beds were as soft as feather which allowed us to sleep. We were awaken around 11pm to 1am by someone on the 41st floor jumping onto the ground. III. PoolA. Covid enforcementThe staff wear their masks around the hotel including the pool area. The seats are sanitized with a towel on to of the seats. The chairs are 6ft per pair of chairs front, sideways, and back. There are security staff enforcing face masks. There is a speaker indicating to enforce social distancing. This is where I have to ask how the mask wearing rules are enforced:1. No one wears masks in the pool.2. People going in and to other pools are not wearing masks.3. People are on chairs not wearing masks.4. Life guards by pool with no face masks.I had looked around and noticed that not everyone was wearing a mask while on a chair. I had to take my Pepto from a night of toilet visits and my mask was half off to take my pills. I was told to wear my mask by the security guard. My girl indicated that the same guard didn't enforce on the rest of the guests on other chairs. Too much power? Or selected because I look Asian looking?  Was I to be the example?  As I walked out of the pool area,  a mixture of people were on chairs with masks off and staff were not enforcing on them. It was that one moment where I got selected to made an example off by one staff member security guard that may have been on a power trip that made the start of my day worse off. It took this one security guard to make me evil eye the rest of the staff and it was the same security guard that made not feel relaxed at the Palazzo pool. Palazzo management, please educate your staff not to select 1 person and to enforce on everyone. This made the start of my second day feeling upset and fired up, I came to relax and enjoy the pool. I didn't go into the pool today. I got upset with my girl and now this trip is starting to suck. Please be equal when enforcing non-mask wearing. Was still fired up at the time of my disagreement with my girl.B. Quantity with Quality There is a total of about ... to be continued at the end of the trip. Still at the Palazzo."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"Visited last night for dinner at CUT - lots of safety and cleaning measures in place, had a great evening!"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"I chose this hotel after reading all of the great reviews online. I am starting to see a pattern in both the lack of representation of blacks in these reviews and possibly even some fake reviews, after having done some research on the reviewers.Our room was not completely clean when we arrived, which required us calling for room service and we were nervous if the room was COVID safe. Then the elevators were unbelievably busy wi the long waits to go up and down with no public stairs as an option to just go 1-2 floors.Lastly and most disappointing was the obvious treatment of the white people ahead of us in line to check in and get service and then how they treated us. We never even got to enjoy the swimming pool on a super hot day because there is a wait list that is basically a lottery to go swimming with no compensation or partial refund if you don't get to swim.I am taking my business elsewhere as both a professional and a black patron."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,"Pros: A-1 location; beautiful suite and well cleaned; COVID-19 safety measures well enforced without feeling confining; fine guest serviceCons: more of a warning - don't park at Venetian, it's a long walk to check in; very limited late night dining options; the nightclub wanted a very hefty deposit to skip the line for what looked to be a very average lounge atmosphere Bottom Line: stay here, play elsewhere. And mind where you park"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,Yelp,My husband and I just checked in to a beautiful suite. Thank you Nelli and Ana at reception for the  amazing service.
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"Thanks to covid pricing I was blessed with the opportunity to stay at this Classy Hotel. Cliff notes version: Totally worth the risk! Took 20 min to get our rooms from the front desk but we did upgraded for free so score is 0-0. Room was ablsolutley stunning, large bathrooms, fridge is unusable, packed full of ""Purchasable"" Beverages. 24 hour Room Service! But inconsistent. Friendly, professional staff.i must warn you...the $32 ""American Breakfast"" taste & looks like items that is straight from the Buffet (which is closed) and it took over 50min to get to the room. 2nd time ordering took 25 min and the French Toast was amazing. Hotel staff is always within line of sight, (with the exeption of the room hallways.) Didn't rent a car this trip but Taxi's are conviently waiting outside the Hotel's entrance."
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"We've stayed all over the strip but this was our first stay at the Bellagio. We wanted to have a pool day too.No valet but self parking is free. We checked in online & just had to pick up the keys. The hotel has hand sanitizer & disposable masks all over the place. Plus when you get to your room there is a welcome gift of 2 masks, hand sanitizer & 2 cool little tools to push buttons, etc to minimize germ spread. The room was a decent size & the bathroom was big with a separate soaking tub. However the shower was below standard. It was a small square with a regular shower head that had water scale growing all over it.The mini bar was ridiculously over priced & you are not allowed to move anything to store your own items or you get charged. The dark out curtains were a nice touch, but overall the room seemed dated & due for a remodel. The pool area was pretty good. There are multiple pools, all a good size & separated by plants, walkways. The service at the pool was excellent & never slow. Everything is really expensive so be prepared! The gym was one of the biggest ones I've seen at a vegas hotel. You have to wear a mask though unless you are on the cardio machines- so i stayed on a cardio machine. I can't workout & wear a mask.Overall the Bellagio is a nice hotel but not the nicest rooms I've seen (they are not bad by any means though). Quite a few of the restaurants were closed & only one place offered food after like 7pm, which was disappointing. We ended up eating across the street."
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"I've heard a lot of reviews from the Bellagio and although I've been staying in several hotels in Vegas, I've never been a guest here. Beginning from arrival, the impression was great so far: The location's great, the parking wasn't hard to find (nor was it a far walk from the hotel lobby) and the staff was amazing. Upon parking and proceeding to the lobby, you begin to notice signs advising to wear masks and sanitize. It wasn't distant from the hotel lobby so I got their fairly quick and they do check your temperature prior to getting in line. The staff allows only the check-in guest to wait in line and check-in which is actually great to prevent clogging of the line. The front desk representatives were helpful answering several questions and provided superb guest services. I ended up getting a room with a nice view of the strip and in front of the water show.The room was very spacious and clean (even had a seal to show the room was sanitized and clean). The bathrooms were nice and big, consisting of a tub, a vanity, a toilet and a luxury shower. Toiletries included and nothing visibly dirty. The entrance hallway had a window to check yourself out before exiting. The bed was comfortable (so were the couches) and the wardrobe was awesome! There was a wardrobe (forgot to take a picture) and had drawers for your clothes. There was a safe conveniently placed in one of the nightstands and the TV had real decent channels. Overall the room itself was awesome. The casinos there were pretty decent, not looking outdated or boring. Although everything was great, there's always room for improvement. One of those being TV connections. I brought my PS4 to play some music (although we weren't going to use it alot), but the TV wouldn't connect at all. It would stay on the TV channel. The next thing would be the elevators. When waiting for the elevator you have to run to it because it closes real quick. Last thing would be the roaches. In my years of staying in different Vegas hotels, I've never seen a roach present till now. I killed some at 3am and then one around 8am. I was going tell this to the receptionist, but it was my last night and in the morning I left, checking out virtually to avoid the long line. Besides this, the stay was excellent. I would definitely recommend this stay to anyone who wants a great stay. It can be pricey, but due to Covid-19, it's a reasonable price. Another thing I forgot to mention is parking, currently due to Covid, it's free which is excellent, although hotels should be making parking free for their hotel guests. I definitely will be staying here next time I visit!"
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"I assumed the Bellagio would be a luxurious stay, but I was wrong. When I got into my room, I thought it hadn't been renovated in decades. Then, I found out the hotel was established in 1998 (I happened to be staring at the gross floor and saw a ""est 1998"" seal on the floor). I'm pretty sure that my two queen bed room had never been renovated. This room had so many problems. The sink gargled really loudly at night and was really annoying. The TV wouldn't turn off - the backlight would stay on and, since we stayed during Halloween, reminded us of the Ring. I had to unplug it manually to turn it off.The internet was really slow, making it difficult for me to work. The toilet paper holder didn't come with the bar, so there was toilet paper stacked on the toilet. Why housekeeping didn't bother to fix it is beyond me. The floor was gross and the hallways smelled like an old building.I would never stay here again."
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"It's hard to understand where the $50 a night resort fee goes to if there's no coffee maker in the room. Nickel and diming feels more extreme when it's pretty empty due to covid. The mask police by the pool when there is no one anywhere close to 6 feet away is also annoying and much worse than other strip pools I went to this trip. It's a shame to have to give such a beautiful hotel such a low rating.Also having issues with room plumbing, the shower head is medicore and needs to be replaced, etc. Really not impressed.It gets better. They tried to not let me in to the pool area with ""outside drinks and snacks"". Rice crackers and smart water. They did eventually let me in but wow. Really not feeling the love."
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"Out of all the hotels we loved the Bellagio it was absolutely beautiful and clean. The art was incredibly breathtaking and the water show was so amazing. We definitely had a sense of winning when playing at the casino, as we almost won $10,000+ LOL, next time! Lol This hotel was incredibly clean and The air quality was awesome! We didn't leave smelling like an ashtray LOL. We definitely look forward to visiting this beautiful establishment in the near future."
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"This hotel was a dream to stay at. It's so beautiful! We were on the 24th floor- 23 and 24 are special ""stay well"" floors. There main thing for me was no smoking. The room was nice and large and the king size bed was so comfy. The bathroom was very large with 2 sinks and separate tub and showers. They had a lot of little amenities provided- Shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion, tooth brush, mouth wash, shower cap, shaving cream, slippers...The restaurants here were great, we loved the Mayfair supper Club. We had fun with the slots, time at one of the pools and watching the fountain show."
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"This place is pretty worn out considering it's only about 20 years old.  It was the crown jewel of the strip at some point, but not anymore.  Our room was rather dirty and worn out.  A half-drunk coke greeted us in the minibar.  The wall paper in the dirty bathroom was peeling.  And, sorry to say this, but the clientele at the hotel were mostly filthy looking types with work clothes and tattoos, etc.  The Bellagio has sort of turned into a Motel 6 with a fountain.  We didn't use the pool (COVID) but still were charged a $51 resort fee.  Hey, at least the parking is free."
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,One of the best hotels We've stayed at out on the strip . One for the books most definitely . We stayed in the cypress suite and let tell you it was to die for . The water show from your bed the his and hers bathrooms one with a tub one with a shower . Little living room with tv and sound bar definitely willBe returning to Vegas soon just to get the room again . Spent most time with the drapes open watching the view ..
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,If you haven't seen the fountains at Bellagio then please make sure it's on your bucket list. They are captivating! Bellagio sits in the center of the strip across from the Paris and magnificent mile so it's in am amazing location. They always have a year round live garden desolations that is breathtaking. Not to mention a beautiful horse in the lobby. It's just something you have to see to believe. A lot of people don't know that the Bellagio has the world's largest flowing chocolate fountain. Lots of upscale restaurants and shops and of course plenty of gambling!
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"Bella bellagio!!What else to say??! Love the hotel. Love the forum. The shops, the flowers, the fountains! The restaurants!! Several of them inside here are my goto: some for the views and some because it's just really good. The rooms are pretty good too from when I did stay. I always end up finding myself staying at Venetian and Cosmo over this though. For the rooms alone. But I come here for everything else! Their crazy brunch buffet with 21+ girls: check!!! The fountain shows, Mon Ami Gabi for dinner, Lago ( gorgeous views) , Spago ( gorgeous food)! Scarpetta ( Pasta x fountain show) and many shops! Many! Rooms are smaller/ lower ceiling for my liking. I like it taller/ bigger/ brighter with a lot of windows. Which is opposite of the rooms here. But if you're not picky, it's just as good as any! And countless things to do inside this hotel. What's not to like."
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"I have yet to actually get to stay here, but Bellagio is my favorite spot on the strip! The conservatory and the water fountains are my two most favorite things about Vegas! Last trip to Vegas we probably watched the water show at different times and different spots at least a dozen times, just absolutely love it!! The staff here are the best, kindest, and most helpful I've encountered in Vegas. They go above and beyond being top notch. There's a gelato and coffee shop in here that is so good! I consistently get stellar service, the gelato portions are very generous and the croissants are huge, buttery, flakey, and so deliciously perfect! My next getaway with my husband I am so planning to be to Vegas and staying at the Bellagio!"
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"(This review is long over due!)My boyfriend and I stayed at the Bellagio for the first time in November 2019 and had such a great experience from the beginning! The front desk agent, Jacqueline, was super friendly and energetic! We let her know that it was our two year anniversary and she was kind enough to get us a nice room that wasn't too far from the elevator. Jacqueline made our first time experience perfect! It pays to simply be nice to front desk agents, people!! (I would know, I used to work at a hotel front desk in San Diego)The room was one of the cleanest, most updated rooms we've stayed on the strip, aside from Caesars Palace! (Sorry not sorry MGM resorts)I can't wait to stay here again! (:A few things to note: - Make sure your hotel door closes SHUT. It's a slow and heavy door which was a pain because we almost left our door slightly cracked a few times before leaving for the day..... eek!- MGM Resort won't comp you anything if you only play table games at their location. They only comp if you play slots, WHICH IS A BUMMER BECAUSE WE SPENT OVER $1000 and many hours playing blackjack... come on MGM. GET IT TOGETHER and comp us table game players!!!"
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"Bellagio is one of my favorite hotels in Vegas.  The service and atmosphere is top notch 5 stars.  The hotel is located conveniently at midpoint of the Vegas strip.  The interior starting from the front lobby is classy and elegant.  The conservatory is beautifully decorated with changing themes.  I try to visit here even when I'm not staying at this hotel. There are so many attractions all in one place.  There is also the water fountain show that is quite spectacular.  If gambling does not interest you, then hit the pool area or go shopping at one of their high end boutiques.  The casino gaming area is spacious and offers table games and plenty of slot machines. I love staying at this beautiful hotel.  This is one of the better MGM properties that keep bringing me back on every visit to Vegas.  Not to mention they have one of the best buffets!"
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"We decided to take a quick trip out to Sin City for the 3 day weekend.  We opted to fly in for the most relaxing experience.  Traffic can get crazy during holidays.  We chose this hotel since it's in a centralized location on the strip.  Bellagio is aesthetically pleasing as soon as you arrive at the front entrance. When you walk into the lobby check in area, you will be in awe of the classy and elegant decor.  Especially the Chihuly art blossoms on the ceiling.  Simply gorgeous!  The front desk staff are friendly and accommodating. We received superior service from day one until check out.  The most popular attraction is the Bellagio fountain show.  It features live music and an amazing water show.  They also have a Conservatory and Botanical Garden, Fine Art Gallery, luxury shops, ""O"" by Cirque du Soleil, Sports Bar Lounge, and Hyde night club etc. The Fountain View room will definitely give you front row seats of the water show.  The room is spacious and tastefully decorated.  The amenities include: king sized bed, standing shower with separate sunken tub, LCD tv, lounge chairs, desk and the city view. I enjoyed my stay at Bellagio for two nights.  Make sure to sign up or use the M life rewards. I would come back for a re-visit. Nothing but the best from this hotel!"
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,Absolutely beautiful inside and out. The architecture of the building is very intricate and the staff is all around to help you to where you're going. The water show occurs every 15 minutes. It happened to start while I was walking along the strip. They played the national anthem to the water show and it was quite entertaining.I will consider staying at this hotel during my next visit.
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"Very poor experience overall at Bellagio during my stay on Saturday 09/19/20. Provided that Bellagio boasts about their COVID safety protocols, I was very surprised to check in to our room and find hair and dirt stains on the bed, deodorant marks on furniture, oil and handprints on the windows, unclean cups in the room, and dirt on the room chair. When we went to talk to the front desk about the issue, we were told we had to wait in the 30 minute line for check in even though we had already checked in to get it resolved. We asked to have a manager come talk to us, and a lady working in the line as an usher let us know she would get the manager for us and then proceeded to take a lunch break without getting the manager. Only after waiting for the 30 minutes in line did we get our room switched. Restaurant lines were all busy, food was hard to find for breakfast, and our switched room didn't have basics like a liner for our ice holder. Overall, it was a disastrous hotel stay and I felt the staff had little care about the condition of our room and fixing the situation. Being in the middle of a pandemic, Bellagio exemplified that they do not walk the walk and just talk on their COVID protocols. Also, they demonstrated little interest in reaching out to the guest to fix their experience and keep them satisfied."
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"Bellagio opened two weeks ago and I scored a free comp room. My family and I arrived on a Saturday afternoon in June. We hard a hard time finding parking at the Bellagio parking lot so we circled twice on 3rd floor and found one. Once we entered, we were scan of our temperature. The line to check in was short and I was checked for my temperature so I didn't do the Mobil check-in. For upgrade, it would cost $150 so I declined. Reminder to get a card at the front desk to use to scan from the elevator to the room. My room was on 21st floor so the wait for elevator wasn't too bad. The outdated room had the view of the swimming pool. The beds was firm, water flow to wash hair needs more power, and AC was great. Checkout was easy. The casino floor during daytime wasn't crowded. Most people had the mask on since it was mandatory on my my arrival. If playing slots, the change machine doesn't offer change anymore instead go to the cashier. The tables had partition and the slots had every other chair. Plenty of mask available, washing sink,  and sanitizers on the floor. FYI, don't drive anywhere cause parking lot gets full. No parking fees, need to wear mask."
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"I finally got to stay at Bellagio with MyVegas 2 complementary nights and just paid for room tax, tax, and resort fee $183.00 including paid extra for fountain view.  The room is very nice and larger than size of Aria room.  The bed is very comfortable with goose down pillows.  The tv has a enough channels, including Chinese channels which is very is a nice feature.  The chairs are comfortable with nice view of the fountains. The bathroom is large and roomy.  The décor is mostly orange and peach color and very relaxing on the 9th floor of south wing.  The elevator is never crowded and very fast. Also, Its a short walk from parking garage to reservation desk.  I didn't see any parking machines in the parking garage floors as reported (charging parking fees). Overall, I would come back to stay. It's very central to everything.Problem:-long walk from reservation desk to the room.  - one of beds was too late lumpy-toilet is too loud after flushed-long line to get to self parking due to people crossing the street and only one way out."
Bellagio Hotel,Yelp,"The Bellagio is a luxury property roughly on par with Wynn/Encore and with Palazzo.  The Bellagio is quite a bit older than Wynn/Encore, but you wouldn't know it.  It's a very well kept property that doesn't look dated anywhere..    The standard rooms are nice, but a step down from the Palazzo's standard rooms, which are junior suites with a step-down sitting area and a significantly larger bathroom. The hotel restaurants with a few exceptions all tilt strongly high end.  Steve Wynn built Bellagio and Wynn/Encore, and all three share this trait.  It's something to be aware of depending on what you are looking for. Check-in was easy (as it should be at this price point), and our fountain view room was available when we arrived around 3:30.  Without prompting, the registration clerk who checked us in moved us to a higher floor to have a better view of the fountains.  This was a nice touch.What about COVID?  (1) All employees wear masks, and guests are required to wear masks, too, except in your room or when seated in a restaurant.  Plexiglas barriers were widely used.  For instance the table games all had barriers between each player and between the players and the dealer.  For me, all of this was a downer, but what are you going to do?  (2) The buffet and some restaurants are closed.  (3) The shows are closed. Some additional practicality observations:Not all Vegas strip properties are easy to get to, and it's not always easy to park.  If you are driving to Vegas, which I prefer, the Bellagio is super easy to get to from the I-15 whether you are traveling northbound or southbound.  Take the Flamingo Road exist and drive east toward Las Vegas Blvd.  Turn right on Las Vegas Boulevard and get in the right lane.  Your there when you see the Bellagio self-parking sign.  Self-parking is a snap.  One nice feature is the light above every parking space that indicates whether the space is available or not.  Also, you don't have a long hike from the parking structure to the hotel, and you don't have to traipse through the casino to get to the registration desk.  Parking is now free again.  Charging for parking was a bad idea the Bellagio appears to have abandoned.  Free parking has been a cherished tradition in Las Vegas for decades.Be sure to use the do not disturb sign.  At about 10:30 a.m. on our checkout day, housekeeping tapped on the door and before I could say, just a second, opened the door.  It was an intrusion we could have done without."
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"Granted I was a guest and not paying, so this review is for someone who got to experience the Aria Sky Suites without seeing the price tag. Three of us had a two bedroom suite, which had a bar/kitchen area, THREE bathrooms, and a dining  room and living room. The beds were incredibly comfortable and the master suite bathrooms were bigger than my Brooklyn apartment. The shower had a freaking steam room feature, there were walk in closets, and the toilet had a rear and front bidet and GD heated seats. There's a huge tub to soak, but the jets didn't work. Didn't matter, it was relaxing and I honestly didn't leave the room besides at night because it was that sweet. The VIP section is a little meh, wine in the afternoon and cheese and croissants and stuff in the early part of the day, but you can hoarde free water and soda to avoid the astronomical fees in the room."
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"OK, strap in for a long one here. Before I get into this review and the story that precipitated it, I want to set a few things up. My wife and I have stayed at Sky Suites nearly a dozen times over the years; we go out there 2-3 times a year and Sky Suites is usually the destination (we stayed at Bellagio this past July only because, when we originally booked, Aria was still closed due to COVID). We've typically reviewed in the 8-10/10 range, but over the last few stays, it's been declining. We love the overall Aria/CityCenter environment, the location, etc. Conceptually, Sky Suites should be a slam dunk every time. In concept, they pull out all the stops.In execution, they have routinely demonstrated ineptitude when it comes to preventing and mitigating issues--most likely, this is due to the staff lacking the empowerment to deal with issues among luxury clientele. I understand limitations or refusals to bend in freebie rooms. But, when dropping four figures a night, the staff should pretty much be able to do whatever they need to in order to rectify a situation.My wife and I woke up one morning around 6:30 a.m. to the sound of water dripping in the bathroom. As it happened, our upstairs neighbor had overflowed their tub. I immediately called down to report the issue. The ceiling was damaged, the recessed light was falling in, and water was flowing. Obviously, this wasn't Sky Suites' fault. We weren't even mad about it; we thought it was funny (""Some guys can't handle Vegas!""). We agreed that we'd stay out of the room for the duration of the day so maintenance could fix everything and be done with it. No harm, no foul. (I think, at this point, a little token room credit of like $100 or whatever for the inconvenience would be the obvious play, but apparently I'm wrong. Apparently, I'm still having a full-fare ""luxury experience"" at this point.)My wife returned at 10:30 p.m. Nothing had been addressed. Water was still dripping into the room and it was spreading. She slipped and almost injured herself. She went to the front desk. For her inconvenience, she was offered a $250 credit and the opportunity to move rooms. I was at NYNY playing when she called me. I gave up my Friday night to deal with everything.I know 2-BR penthouses are limited in quantity, so it's hard to move someone in our position. The manager on duty at the time wasn't on in the morning and so he inherited the mess. But unaddressed and untenable it was, and now, rather than us dealing with everything during the day, we were going to have to move rooms in the middle of the night. I had to call my friend back from playing to pack up his things (he was staying in the second bedroom). We were dropped nine floors. I suggested an upgrade to a villa; seemed like fair recompense and, at that point, I'd have let everything go. Apparently, Eric didn't have the authority to make that happen.Penthouse #2? Well, it had a leaky showerhead that had to be repaired (so maintenance was in that room from 11:30 to 12:30). We found a used container for illegal drugs. There was water damage on the second bedroom wall. Several lights were out and other items weren't functioning properly. There were screw holes in the front door of the suite.In the end, I spent nearly eight hours of my trip dealing with the issues. We received no offer to upgrade, a mere $250 credit, just one night off, and ""a free upgrade on the next trip"" (which isn't gonna happen, BTW). What they should have done is, without any haggling needed on my end, is comp the trip. It was that bad and that bungled. ""Trey, this situation has been totally botched and it's completely unacceptable. Here's another room that's not quite as good (because we don't have any identical ones). You're not having a true 'luxury experience' and you've been a loyal guest for years. To make up for it, enjoy the rest of your trip on us and we can't wait to see you next time."" But, no. I still very much had a nice hit on the card when I got home. I have half a mind to dispute the charge. Had they done that or sent us upstairs to a villa, we 1,000% would go back.But they didn't do either.We've officially given up on Sky Suites. It's been deteriorating for years and we've indicated that in the surveys. Simple maintenance items haven't been regularly addressed. Staff can't (or won't) do what is needed to make a bad situation right. I'm not going to pay thousands for a ""luxury experience"" (their terminology) that's anything but. It's a five-star resort. It behaves like a two; the staff is undisciplined, incapable, and there's zero attention to detail."
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"After our first night staying at Aria Sky Suites, unfortunately I am less than impressed. So we'll start at a 2.5 star review.I picked this hotel to celebrate my 10 year work anniversary and our 9 year anniversary as well as a mini family vacation with my in-laws. We booked a 2 bedroom suite for our 4 night stay to relax and be together as a family. We choose it for the privacy, the room size, the pool, casino, and lounge. After we checked in we went to our room on the 56th floor. For a non-smoking floor we were greeted with the smell of weed. Sigh. We are traveling with a toddler and didn't appreciate that being our welcome. The room itself was nice and clean. But there is an intermittent knocking that can be heard in both rooms and the bedroom. It would startle us when we're just lounging, taking a nap, or trying to sleep. It was random and closer to the windows, possibly the AC. Another issue was the Toto washlet in one of the bedrooms was not connecting to the remote. We rebooted it, but didn't work. Also FYI the cords for the media console doesn't come with connectors (there's one available for  purchase). Luckily my tech husband knows how to fix things and brought his own cords, then dug behind the drawers for the connector that was disconnected from the TV and reconnected it. Not really something he was looking to do on vacation. I brought these issues to the attention of the front desk the next morning. Janet that checked us yesterday, helped me again this morning. She was very understanding and sympathetic. She was able to offer us a food and beverage credit. Unfortunately that doesn't work for our family as we don't drink, have our own family friendly food/snacks, and tend to eat off strip. The manager Paula called and was able to apply the credit instead to our room which is more beneficial for our family. We haven't been here one full day, and these issues have been a little disappointing. So hopefully the rest of our stay will be the 5 stars it's claimed to be."
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"The property is beautiful. The staff is very nice. We stayed in the 2-bedroom penthouse suite. Phenomenal views and accommodations. FYI: Fiji waters in the room are $24.75 each. It would have been a better experience if it didn't constantly smell like weed. We stayed on the 27th floor. The hallways, elevators, and outside walkways always smelled like weed. Our children came with us, and it was disappointing to experience that smell/exposure constantly. Although the hotel makes you understand that the rooms are non-smoking, the do nothing to keep people from doing it."
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"I've been staying at the Aria Sky Suites for many, many years. We were introduced to Bobbi Hart, the director of guest relations, and she is the sweetest, most professional person we've ever encountered in a hospitality setting (our personal concierge is great too, I just forgot their name!). She exudes such warmth and makes us feel at home even when we're on vacation. Bobbi always goes the extra mile to make sure our stays are memorable. Last month, I took my sister to the Aria for her birthday and Bobbi arranged for balloons, champagne and a birthday cake to be sent to her room. We're always wowed at Bobbi's level of commitment to her job and her clients.  The Sky Suite rooms are spectacular. We always get the split suite with two rooms and a kitchen with a living area between them. Our M Life rewards program helps us get discounted room rates. The lounge is always well stocked with drinks and goodies. The staff there is very attentive and professional. We also love the private entrance, as it's much easier to get in and out of. As far as the hotel itself, I feel like there is a certain refined, upscale ambiance at Aria. I don't feel like it's as hectic as some of the other resorts. For us, Aria is central to everything we like to do in Vegas. The location and ambiance coupled with Bobbi's stellar service makes us repeat customers."
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"Rooms are great, very spacious compared to the non Sky Suite rooms.  If you're going to stay at Aria, this tower is really the only way to go.  Take advantage of the much larger bathrooms, bedrooms, living room, wet bar area and heightened level of service; the views aren't too shabby either!  The best part of Sky Suites though is the spacious lounge, with tons of complimentary beverages, snacks and wine in the afternoon."
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"Gorgeous check in area, nicely decorated with complimentary hot/cold beverages & hors d'oeuvre! Gave my daughter a super cute gift upon check in! Sweetest knowledgeable staff! Love this hotel!"
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"Kyle Patterson, ""sky suites supervisor""at Aria casino is a the most horrible awful person that thinks it funny to mess with a my baby and handicapped father!Thought it was necessary to raid our room! At midnight!!! For a declined credit card charge that happened over 24 hours ago!He didn't even try to call me all day! For me to fix it! Give me a chance to call credit card company.. or just give him a other credit card! Instead , he raids our room at midnight!!! With a sleeping baby. And my handicapped father!And he was smiling the whole time! Like we were criminals!Keep in mind we have been ""High Roller Vip guests"" here  for many many many years . So uncalled for.  We were treated like criminals for a declined credit card charge that never was made aware to us!"
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"Aria Sky Suites, how do I love thee?  Let me count the ways ...For starters, you picked up me and the Mr from the airport in a limo, to be dropped of at our private check in area.While I was initially annoyed because my 1 bedroom penthouse with Strip view was not ready until 2:56 pm (check in is at 3 pm), the room and the service we received soon trumped my grumpiness.  As a peace offering, the front desk sent us champagne and chocolate covered strawberries to our room.  Apology accepted!There are snacks and drinks down in the lobby area, including Fiji Water, which was a nice perk.  They also offer nightly wine and cheese starting at 4 pm. Score!!We arrived to our room, with the most beautiful views of the Strip.  In room coffee maker with 2 cups of coffee and water for the Keurig were provided each day. Want to look at the nutritional info of the mini bar snacks?  No problem, Aria gets it!  Take a gander in under 60 seconds, otherwise they assume you want it and will charge you (unlike other hotels that charge you if you so much as breathe on it)The steam shower in my bathroom helped my Houstonian nose recover from the dry, desert air.  This is something I used each day and this is the only hotel I have stayed at in Vegas that offered this (I'm not saying others don't, just saying I have not encountered this at Four Seasons, Cosmo, Mandalay, MGM or Venetian).With the Sky Suites, you get tram service included, as well as other incentives on food and beverage, and private pool area. We will definitely be back here to carry on our love affair with this place!"
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,Everything is so beautiful!! We never stay anywhere else except for the Aria. The past 3 visits in 2019 have been in either the sky suites and 1 tower suite stay. My kids never want to come back home! I can never go back to a regular room now. Room service food is also so good.
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"If everything in the room had been working properly when we arrived, this would be a 5-star rating for sure. The only reason I think Aria Sky Suites deserves a 4-star rating is because we arrived to our quite pricey 2-bedroom penthouse suite to find that 2 of the 4 TVs in the room did not work, 1 of the 2 jacuzzi tubs did not work, the doorbell to our room did not work, and a couple of lamps did not work or had burned bulbs. Normally those kinds of problems would lead me to give a 1- or 2-star rating at best. But there were several other aspects of our stay that deserved 5 stars, so I evened it out to be a 4-star overall rating.With that said, the fact that no one at the hotel offered *any* sort of remedy for these problems is a concern. There was no offer by the front desk or a manager of even a free buffet or something simple for our troubles. I was actually surprised at that, given the level of all the problems we encountered.On our first day there, the maintenance staff was able to fix the 2 TVs. On the morning of our second day, the maintenance staff was able to fix the jacuzzi tub in one of the two bedrooms. The doorbell to the room was never fixed. The biggest problem was the jacuzzi tub that didn't work on that first day. When guests pay many hundreds of dollars for one of the most expensive suites in a 5-star resort, they expect things to be in working order when they arrive.The room was beautiful and featured several live plants, which was nice. The color palette was warm, and the environment modern. Furniture was upscale, comfortable, and not marked up with damage and nicks like you find in many (if not most) hotels.The housekeeping staff was great... friendly, professional, and top notch. Due to the fact we had no doorbell working and couldn't put our ""privacy"" button on or hang a ""do not disturb"" sign, it seemed like they must've come in and out of the room almost every time we left. The garbage cans were always empty in the room, a little package of 5 chocolates would show up un-announced, and the room would be refreshed more than once during the day. The staff overall was very friendly, and you simply can't beat the privacy that comes from a separate entrance to the Sky Suites, away from the hustle and bustle of the casino. The woman who greeted us at the private check-in was incredibly friendly and professional, and the entire check-in process took only about 3 to 5 minutes. It was a breeze. Only one time during our stay did we have other people in our elevator with us, and we never had to wait for elevators. For regular Vegas travelers, you know how rare that is.The Sky Suites Lounge - a private area with complimentary snacks and drinks - was a real treat. (And I say that as someone who almost always finds these types of things annoying.) Around-the-clock free coffee, wine, soft drinks, tea, juices and snacks are yours... in a really nice, comfortable setting that is inviting to all. They had croissants, apple turnovers, different breads and cheeses and crackers, and all sorts of food items at various times of the day. This is a much nicer perk than I thought it would be, and the staff was constantly hard at work, refreshing everything. I was really impressed.Overall, it was a quite good stay. It would've been outstanding though, if they'd had everything in working order in the room when we arrived. At such a $$$$ room rate, this is a pretty big faux paus that Aria will want to fix."
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"Wow !  Do you want a great Vegas experience?  You're sure to find it at the Aria ... the lounge is a nice quiet place to relax and well stocked with healthy snacks and an array of beverages... the living walls make for a very spa like , soothing experience z and the concierge service second to none.  The rooms are equally well appointed - spacious with lots of big windows and natural light... modern furnishings and pristine cleanliness !!

Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,From check-in to i dont want to cgeck out. Was an experience.The room. The view. The room service.Its Vegas so im guessing all rooms look somewhat similar.. The room was great

Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"We booked our stay at the Aria to celebrate a joint bachelor/bachelorette party. We booked a 2 bedroom penthouse suite for us 2 couples. If you book with sky suites they will send a car to pick you up at the airport- that went flawlessly- our driver was their waiting as soon as our flight landed and was friendly and drove safely. Check-in is when all the problems started. The Aria sky suites is a different tower than the normal hotel guests. Walking into the lobby there were numerous couch and chairs and the lobby was filled with people waiting. We soon learned that the sky suites rooms were not ready for all of these people to check-in. It was a cluster f*** and numerous people were unhappily complaining. We arrived at the hotel around 4:30pm (check-in time is at 3pm), and they did not have any available rooms ready. We were told there were multiple dirty rooms and they did not have adequate cleaning staff. They informed us that the next available room is a smoking room but we told them we had previously booked a non-smoking room. After numerous discussions and complaints they eventually let us wait in a regular sky suites room until our 2 bedroom suite was ready. At 6pm they informed us our room was ready and led us into a smoking room which we immediately told them we could not stay in (it reeked horribly of smoke). All 4 of us are in the medical field- 3 of whom are cancer doctors! So again, they told us we needed to wait for another room because they did not have cleaning staff to clean the dirty suites (why would a suite be dirty at 6pm if check out was at 11am???!) Our non-smoking 2 bedroom suite was ready by around 9pm. We basically waited over 4 hours for our room to be ready. They did comp half of that day's stay and our dinner for this setback but it was still stressful and ruined most of that day's plans for us. Once we got into our room, everything was clean and we enjoyed the space. The beds are comfortable and the common area was spacious. Each night we would turn on our privacy light by the door but the housekeeping staff STILL rang the doorbell every morning regardless of this fact. Very ironic that they couldn't find someone to clean our room for 4 hours the day of check-in yet every morning at 11am the housekeeping staff rang our doorbell even though our privacy light was on. They did do a great job of cleaning every day and also with turn down service. The only gripe I have is that the 2nd bedroom was not stocked with lotion the first 2 days of our stay, neither did it a have a hair dryer.Since we had a concierge for our sky suite we booked spa services via our concierge. Our personal concierge told us if we received facials from the spa we could not use the spa facilities- 3 out of 4 of the women still booked a facial regardless. When we arrived to the spa we found out that we actually CAN use the facilities if you book a facial. We specifically did not come early to enjoy the facilities because we didn't think we were allowed to. Had we known, we would have come 2 hours earlier as we did not have any plans and also wanted to use the steam room which is not recommended AFTER receiving a facial. Luckily the spa manager was sympathetic to us and gave our party free spa facility access for the following day.Viewing our bill on the TV before checkout we noticed there were miscellaneous charges from the room titled ""Aria refresh"". Apparently they charged us for a bottle of Johnny Walker, a Rice Krispies treat, and a travel charger none of which we used and all were still present in our room. After an angry 20 minute discussion with someone they sent to our room to investigate, the charges were taken off. When we went down to checkout in the lobby, we noticed that two separate people next to us were arguing about unknown charges from the mini bar on their bills as well (one of which was a bottle of Johnny Walker they claimed they had taken). Everyone beware and check your bills thoroughly cause clearly there's a scam going on there. Such a wonderful way to end our trip after an awful check in experience. Overall, the room we booked was great but the customer service is incompetent and I definitely would not recommend Aria sky suites to anyone."
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,It's disappointing going to a hotel and being excited about it .... just to have two of the 4 people in our room get bitten by bed bugs. Would not come back to this hotel and upset how they handled the situation.
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"Expect royal treatment from Aria Sky suites. Enjoyed The limo pick up and drop off, private entrance, lounge area along with snacks and beverages, relaxing spa, friendly customer service, spacious living room, dining room, bedroom, bathrooms (shower is also a steam room and the toilet seat is heated with a washlet installed) and easy to work iPads to control everything inside the suite.  Beautiful views of the strip. First class experience."
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"This was my first time staying at Aria, so I decided to splurge a little for a Sky Suite....I'm glad i did.For those that don't know, Aria Sky Suite guests have a private check in and might i add there are only 46 hotels in the WORLD to hold both the AAA Five Diamond and Forbes Five Star Awards. The check in area also has an entrance to this huge private lounge exclusive to Sky Suite guests where they provide unlimited juices, snacks, soda and Fiji waters to guests. They also have a nightly cheese & wine reception- classy.I booked the Penthouse- The Suite itself was stunning as the decor and layout was completely different than you'd expect to find in most hotels. Everything is controlled by a tablet, but when you enter the room the lights turn on, the TV turns on and the curtains open. If you set the tablet to the ""Romance"" setting, all TVs in the suite will play jazz and the lights will dim. The bathroom had an automatic toilet with built in bidet and tush dryer. In this majestic bathroom you will also find a big soaking tub with jets with a panoramic view of the city.....the shower has a steam room setting. You'll just have to look at my pictures to get the full experience.Spa: Their Spa is very nice, it includes an out door co-ed large therapy pool (hot tub temperature), Eucalyptus steam room,hot tubs and more. There is dark chocolate and other higher end offerings for guests of the spa.There are so many components of Aria to experience that i would break the internet listing them all- It's an amazing property and I can't wait to go back!"
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"BEST hotel suite I have ever stayed at. Just the space, luxury, technology. We booked a suite at the hard rock hotel and the first night was so disappointing that we booked a suite at the Aria for the rest of the stay.Aria sky suites have a separate check in and have guest entrance control security. There's a club lounge. Several elevators depending on your suite location.Bathroom has everything from bathtub in the middle of the space to views over the desert. The rooms are enormous with all top notch technology.Aria is my favorite hotel I ever stayed at, not only in Las Vegas but overall!"
Aria Sky Suites,Yelp,"For my 700th Yelp review. a) It had to be a 5-star rating, and b) it had to be something lucky, like something Vegas...here we go.Aria is nice. Aria Tower Suites are nicer. Aria SkySuites....well damn. Isn't this the way life was supposed to be lived? Limo rides to and from airport. Check.Separate check-in and concierge. Check.Massive suites. Check.Master bath bigger than my first apartment. Check.Toilet seat warmer and naughty bits cleaner. Yup, check.Okay, this list could go on forever. But our 2-room and living room suite was a ton of space for just two people. We had 3 flat screen huge TVs, 2 and 1/2 bathrooms, a Jacuzzi, and yes a heated toilet. I mean I have stayed in some nice rooms in Vegas, but this one...this one was the bees t*ts. Best part is we went during the calm prior to Xmas and the SkySuite upgrades were super cheap. I thought the Tower Suite reservation would be nice, but getting the keys to a whole other side of the resort (with a private pool area too), and all the additional amenities and square footage was amazing. Limos were available pretty much at our needs to. Private check-in. Private entrance. Had zero issues w/ the restaurants we wanted (even off-property). And just the nicest staff folks. We had one minor issue with a lamp that wouldn't turn on manually or through the room integrated iPad (yes I said room integrated iPad for all lights, curtains, tub, TVs, etc...basically if it was electronic, the iPad controlled it. I could have probably washed my butt with the iPad controller...miss out on that, damn). Any way...one broken light. They brought not a new bulb...a new lamp...in under 5 minutes. Wow. So to say we had a comfortable, quiet, restful, amazing 3-nights stay is an understatement. SkySuite life is the only way to do Vegas."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"Me and el viejo had an amazing stay at Caesars this past weekend!  We did a two night stay and both check in and check out we're easy and simple but that might have been due to the fact that we arrived at 9 am on Friday and paid the extra $70 for early check in and also checked out before 10 am.  In my opinion getting there early and paying the extra money was worth it because when we passed by the check in area after 12 pm it was PACKED, even the express check in/out lines were long. Our room was cleaned really well and was spacious. A bonus was the hot tub in the bathroom. There were snacks in the room but obviously for an extra charge...$8 for a small can of Pringles? No ma'am I'm good. Our view wasn't the best (hello air conditioner units) but it was no biggie. My favorite thing about this hotel is how much there is to do within the actual hotel or at least within walking distance. There are so many restaurants open (2 Gordon Ramsay restaurants, Cafe Americano and The Lobby bar which are both open 24 hours, and Nobu), so many tables and machines for gambling, and the Bellagio water fountain is right next door. El viejo also really enjoyed the Montecristo Cigar Bar. We were never bored and felt comfortable knowing that we could go right upstairs to our room for a quick break. Regarding COVID safety, I'll say it again, they are doing they're best. They provide many hand sanitizer and mask stations, all employees wear masks, machines are spaced out, and they promote social distancing and wearing masks. I did my part by taking my own bottle of hand sanitizer and cleaning wipes and doing a quick clean of the furniture in our room as soon as we walked in. But at the end of the day we're in a pandemic and going to Vegas is my choice, a choice I made knowing the risks. A little plus: get the Caesars Rewards. It's free to sign up and you're able to build points while gambling and even at most restaurants that are under the Caesar's brand. Overall all this hotel was the perfect place to stay at for el viejo's birthday weekend and we'll definitely be back!"
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"We stayed here for 4 days during their WSOP tournament promotion. Since we are still in the midst of pandemic, everything is changed. All valet staff is wearing mask. At the entry to the casino, there is hand sanitizer station and mask. There are many security staff to make sure everyone keeping their masks on. If your mask slipped down just a few seconds, these guys will be on your case!We got upgraded to premier suite in Palace tower. Can I say wow wow!!! The suite is gorgeous and huge! Walking to living room and dining room with city view, through a french door to our bed room with big king bed and sofa, flat screen TV, jack and jill bathroom and tub, I'm feeling like Carrie in Sex and the City movie when she saw the penthouse in Manhattan!All their room is sealed after cleaning. Toiletries are in sealed package. There is a fridge in the room but with alcohol and drinks which you don't want to touch... one slight move, you will be charged. There is no coffee maker in room. There is no ice machine nor vending machine on this floor. You will need to get down the other floor to get ice. That is the only negative thing I could find!!!We did extend an extra day stay so they moved us to Augustus tower. Augustus and Octavius towers are closer to the main entrance and have their own check-in desk. They are however a walking distance from the pool and restaurants. The room is good size, with sitting area and wraparound sofa. Our room was on 45 th floor with the Bellagio fountain view. Most of their restaurants are opened for dine-in, pick up or delivery. We did order to delivery through their website. They do charge 20% for delivery fee.The pool is opened but you will need to make reservation online or wait in line for first-come-first-serve since they limit number of patrons to the pools. You do have to wear mask at the pool unless you are in the water. Overall, we had a great time here. All staff are helpful and excellent. The place is very clean which gives us peace of mind to travel during the pandemic. We definitely will come back soon."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"* Price: not cheap but not the most expensive one on the strip. Compatible with Aria, Wynn, Encore. 3+ star.* Accommodation: nice pool area with plenty of seating lounges, heated pool, spacious rooms, shoppings, many restaurants, late dinning options, Starbuck coffee, Ups store. Free parking and free wifi for 2 devices. 4+ star. * Location: convenient, center of the strip, walking distance to other resorts like Bellagio, Palazzo, etc. 4 + 5.* Motif: grande; several towers with different decors, European renaisance statues and ceiling painting; room is spacious, beautiful bathroom, jacuzzi tub. 4+ star. * Service: this is what they can improve and which drop star rating. 3 star. (Mr. Delano saved the day...)We chose to stay here during July 4th weekend over Aria,  Mandalay,  Bellagio etc. Mainly because they have an awesome firework show and we also enjoyed our last stay a few years ago. We booked a package including hotel+airfare+car via priceline. Arrived early and checked in around 10 AM. We did not expect to have room right away... but tried our luck anyway. The line at general check-in area is long but moving well. The front desk person, Mr. M checked us in who reminded me of ""soup nazzi"" on Seinfeld episode... said ""no"" to everything!  No, you can check in early; no, there is no room available to upgrade (even with extra fee); No, you won't get your room until 4 or 6 pm... to check in early ie. 3 PM, it will cost $30. No, you can't use the facility... we then asked the friendly lady directing traffic at front desk if we can use the pools while waiting for our room. She gave us the room card to show at the pool desk!We came back at 3 PM and had different front desk staff.  Mr. Delano saved the day. We were able to upgrade to petite suite in Palace tower with pool view (with extra fee)!The petite suite is 600 square feet, with Jack and Jill shower, individual toilet and vanities,  jacuzzi tub, plenty of storage, sofar and desk. The room is cleaned and beautiful. There is coffee maker in the room but no supply for coffee.  There are many restaurants, food court with late dinning (pizza and taco places), cafe Americano opens 24 hours, buffet.  The only issue is that you do not get any preference for staying at Cesar Palace when trying to book for these restaurants. We actually booked via open table. Overall,  we enjoyed our stay here... but hesitate to enroll in their loyalty program nor give them 5 star rating mostly due to their mediocre customer service."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"This is our first stay at Caesar Palace for a work conference! Despite of other bad reviews and to our surprise, we really like the place. We stayed at the Octavius tower which is one of the new tower, part of the Laurel collections. We got the room for $265 pulse tax and resort fee per night for the conference rate.For the Octavius and Augustus towers, they have different check-in area... So you can skip all the lines at the main check-in area. These two towers are pretty closed to the pool area. The room is beautiful and large with sitting area, large bathroom with standing shower, a large jacuzzi bath tub, double sink vanity, and a small wall TV. Wifi is included for one device and $20 per day for second device.For the Octavius tower, the odd number rooms have pool view and even number have strip view. The bed is huge and comfortable! Everything is quite expensive... But so is the rest of Las Vegas strip resorts.A small water bottle for $5, Keurig coffee package for $12... You get the picture...The resort has beautiful pool area with many pools and seating area. The pool opens between 9am to 6pm during fall and winter time. The pools are heated... So it is quite nice! The pool lounging bed costs $250 per day and big lounge chair is between $50 to $25 per day (depends on the day and time!) or you can use the regular chair for free charge!The forum shops are great for a fashionista... from reasonable shops (Banana republic, Gap, H&M, etc.) to the high-end stores like Dior, Coach, LV, etc. There are plenty of restaurants in this place (Bobby Flay's Mesa Grills, Nobu, Gordon Ramsay pub and grills, Michel Richard's Central, etc.) The Central is opened 24 hours... There is a food court with reasonable prices. For coffee and sweet, you can get from Payards or Starbucks!This place is huge... You will need a comfortable shoe to explore this place!After staying at the Mandalay, Bellagio's and Cosmopolitan, we probably would stay here again!"
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"We booked our stay here for our business trip earlier this year due to the fact that we were anticipating having our celebratory dinner at Bacchanal (still closed) and also because it's a centralized location on the strip. You can skip the line and check in at their self check in kiosks. This is not a shabby place to rest your head after a day/night of fun sight seeing, gambling, eating, etc, etc...COVID precautions: There were hand sanitizer stations located throughout the hotel/casino and even masks dispensers. However, we did notice quite a few people walking around without masks on and no staff in sight to enforce them to wear one. They encourage no more than 4 people in the elevators. At a glance, I didn't see any slot machines turned off for social distancing purposes. We stayed in the Forum Tower, and I really liked that area of this grand hotel. Our rooms were close to the food court, the Forum shops, the Coliseum (still temporarily closed), and the Uber pick up/drop off designated area. I've read that other people said the rooms were old and dated, but I thought my room was just fine. I loved the rainfall shower head and I realized I need to have a TV screen embedded in my bathroom mirror at home as well (dreaming). Although I didn't get to explore the entire hotel, I would consider staying here again the next time I'm in town mainly for the location. The majority of the other hotels are within a mile radius so they are accessible within walking distance. I will forever remember Caesar's Palace as the first Vegas hotel casino I stayed at on the first of many trips to Sin City!"
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"They charge for parking but you get 1 hour free...Except they took so long on the Membership Rewards Card line, I had to pay $15.00 just for the privilege of getting a card :pYeah, no. Minus one star."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"When people think of Las Vegas, one of the first hotels that come to mind is Caesar's Palace. It now stands as one of the oldest, most opulent, and iconic hotels from an era passed. That's not to say that Caesar's Palace looks or feels old, far from it. This venerable hotel (established 1966) remains one of Vegas's class acts and continues to be the [literal] center point of ""The Strip."" It is one of the largest hotels in Las Vegas. The architecture, layout, and luxury are undeniable. It is also one of the busiest hotels, if not the busiest. From the Forum to the Forum Shoppes to the Nobu Hotel (its hotel within a hotel) to Baachannal Buffet and Omnia Night Club, you must visit Caesar's Palace. That's not to say it doesn't have a few dings in the fender. It hasn't been remodeled since the mid-nineties, I know because I stayed here. And it does show a little age around the edges. The service is certainly not what it used to be compared to pre ""player club card days"" when casino hosts knew all their guests and comping was the norm. And prices, well, like every other hotel on the strip, they no longer rely on gaming revenue for their sole income. So be prepared to spend a few dollars when you stay at Caesar's Palace.All in all, a weekend in Las Vegas requires that you at least stay at Caesar's Palace once in your life to experience the Glitz and Glammer of Sin City, Nevada. When you do, be sure to make it to Bacchanal, one of the best buffets in all of Las Vegas. And I hope you're a pool goer because Caesar's seven swimming and sun-bathing pools are, in my opinion, the class act of sun worshipers."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"I've been visiting this casino for years. But this review is based upon my most recent staycation I had. I needed some much needed alone time away from my kids. Caesars Palace had a deal I just couldn't turn down. I'll just list all the pros and cons to make this review shorter. Pros:1. My room was beautiful. I booked a premium room in the Octavius tower. Well worth the upgrade. It was spacious and very clean. 2. I don't use the bath tubs in hotel rooms because I think it's yucky, but that's just me personally. But the shower was roomy and had good water pressure. 3. My view of the pool was really pretty. 4. The employee at the front desk was very friendly and wiped down the counter before she called me up. Cons:1. The walk from the parking garage to front desk was so far. 2. People were not social distancing through out the casino. People had their masks on half-assed with their nose still exposed. Like what is so hard about wearing it correctly?!?!? 3. The clientele I saw through out the property weren't the best. No need to go into further detail, but I was thinking to myself ""what happened to this place?"" 4. The walls in my room were thin. I could hear people who were talking in the hallway. I had to put a towel down by my door to block the gap that was there.5. The bed was not comfy at all. I actually woke up with an achy lower back.6. Since I had a view of the pool, I could see that they took out some chairs for social distancing. This meant that the pool got busy by 9:30 am and I saw some people sitting on the ground. With all that said, would I stay here again? Only if I got a killer deal on a room, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"This is our first time booking with Caesars Palace, maybe last time too.  The room is certainly spacious and looks very presentable.  However, the resort MUST improve their housekeeping services.  We found obvious black grime in one of the sinks; several pubic hair and blood stains on both bed sheets; also previous guests' hair everywhere in the shower...   really disgusting! Ummm, I really wonder how they follow the Covid 19 cleaning guidelines.  Ofcourse, after few calls to the front desk, the sink was cleaned, sheets were changed.  I would still give them the credit on fast response.  Other than that, Ceasar Palace is really big.  Personally, I would stay choose to stay at Palace Tower instead of Octavivs Tower.  Palace Tower is located much closer to swimming pool and self parking, shops and restaurants."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"Caesars Palace used to be a great hotel and it's gone down hill. We recently stayed at Caesar's, and it was a completely different experience from when I stayed here in the past. Right when you enter the casino, you'll be hit with the smell of tobacco and cannabis smoke, and many people who aren't wearing masks. Check-in line is super long, and you are expected to wait 20-30 minutes to check-in. They do have an express check-in section, but that was also very long. I expected this though since it was the time of when guests were allowed to check into their hotels.Upon arriving in our room, there what appeared to look like barf stain and trash leftover from the previous guest. We requested a nonsmoking room, and the room smelled like smoke. I was extremely disappointed to see that our room was not clean.My husband called room service, and asked about whether the room has been serviced prior to our arrival. The person we spoke to didn't apologize for the uncleanliness of the room, and told us that they can come clean or we can go down to front desk and request a break room. We went down and waited in line again, and we were given a different room along with a drink credit. Upon arrival of our now second room, the smell in the room was completely different and smelled smoke free. There was a stain on the bench next to the bed, but at this point we were over it, since it looked like they tried to clean it before. The sinks were leaky, and we later found out that tv didn't work, soI texted ""Ivy,"" their mobile text helpline. No response. I called front desk instead, and they sent someone over. 35 minutes later someone came and fixed the tv, and right when maintenance left. I got a response from Ivy also 35 minutes later to accept terms for texts from Ivy. Why is this coming in 35 minutes later? What am I paying the $50.02 resort fee per night for?The resort fee is supposed to include WiFi for two devices, pool access, and gym among other amenities. In my opinion, the pool should be included in the actual hotel price, and second, the the WiFi sucks. Your devices will be disconnected from the WiFi and you will manually have to connect to it over and over again. You won't be automatically connected once you register. This is annoying, and is not worth fifty bucks a night!  The gym is also open, but with limited capacity because of COVID. Half the pools were closed. My question is, how can you still charge your guests a ridiculous resort fee, one of the highest on the strip for half access and limited services?  I'm glad they're abiding by health regulations, but the fees do no match what guests are receiving.On top of all of this, one of the elevator at self parking doesn't stop on the third floor. It'll barely open on the third floor and then it'll close on you. Not safe. Never again."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"Recently stayed here with my fiancé and I loved it! We got a room at the Augustus Tower with a strip view and it was absolutely gorgeous!! We were able to see the Paris Eiffel Tower and the water show at the Belagio which was such a nice touch. We had one King sized bed and we got a nonsmoking room. Our room was very clean and our housekeeping lady was a sweetheart! She did such a great job cleaning our room and making sure we had everything we needed. Gotta respect those who are working during a pandemic! The room itself was super spacious for us! There was a couch and coffee table by the window and the bathroom had a private toilet, stand in shower and a bathtub with jets inside. We were also able to see the water show hourly which was so nice! Most of the restaurants were open. Their buffet is closed at the moment though which was unfortunate because we wanted to check it out. We ended up eating at the Trevi Italian restaurant during our stay at it was really good! They also have a Fat Tuesday at the forum shops that's open which we HAD to go check out. Masks weren't strictly enforced unfortunately and I did see a few people in the casino area and forum shops without them. I didn't see the slot machines being cleaned or wiped down very often either so I would keep your hand sanitizer with you at all times and not touch your face until you can get somewhere where you can wash them. The pool was fantastic! Definitely the best pool I've ever seen in Vegas. They have you wear your mask around the pool area but you can take it off once you're in the water and when you're sitting down. Masks again though weren't very strictly enforced and many people were walking around drinking without their masks on. I wish that was more enforced but I understand there's only so much they can do when people are drinking and what not. Overall we had an amazing time and would come back to Caesars palace again! Their prices are very affordable right now due to COVID so I would take advantage of them before they start to go up again! Our room was only $50/night plus the resort fee which is a steal!!!"
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"No complaints here! After staying here for three days, I can definitely say this is the most POPPIN hotel on the strip during Covid. We visited a few other places, but I could tell the most people were  here.We stayed in a suite on the 9th floor in the Palace Tower. The suite consisted of a living room with a dining area, bar with mini fridge and microwave, 4 bathrooms, 2 bedrooms and a his/her closet. This was the best room for our three night stay! So comfortable! And even more, absolutely stunning!Caesars has taken a lot of precautions because of covid. Loved the fact there were so many sanitizing stations throughout the hotel. There is a maximum of four people allowed in the elevators, and there are 4 stickers on the corner in order to help you remember. All the rooms are ""sealed"" and state that they have been sanitized. Additionally, you can make reservations to the pool or order takeout/delivery through a card with a QR code that is available in your room."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"This hotel, out of the 12 different hotel rooms I've stayed in is by far the worst. Literally felt like a best western that upgraded their bathroom to have a tv in it. Caesars in my opinion is a great place to hangout, but not necessarily stay at."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"Ah man, Caesars Palace was a great hotel to stay at during my last trip to Vegas. It was my first time staying with the brand as I'm usually pretty loyal to my MGM Properties, but this stay has me reconsidering things.Check in was a breeze. I didn't realize until after but because I'm diamond with their gaming rewards program, there is actually a side check-in off near the elevators instead of the main check in. There was no line to check-in so I didn't really waste any time. Checking in was a breeze and they fortunately got me to my room early.The room was clean and had an amazing view of their pools. The room featured ample seating which included a couch. The bed was comfy which is a huge plus for me. As a tall person I took full advantage of their tub, but all of the tubs in Las Vegas take forever to fill up because of their size, not complaining just making a statement.The property itself is really large. I did feel like no matter where I went inside of Caesars it took a long time. I'm not newb to Vegas so I know things are naturally far apart, but I've never felt like this inside of the property itself.It's got a great food court. Plenty of amazing restaurants on property. The forum shops. A great casino, which honestly is one of my favorites on the strip.I love their pool and rented a cabana at the Venus pool which is the rental only pool so it's nice and relaxing, a perfect way to unwind during your stay.The valet was great. Super friendly staff. The car was requested and probably less than 5 minutes each time I had it back, which was amazing. I loved the location of the hotel because it was more centralized than staying where I usually stay with the MGM properties. I felt like I was more in the mix.Definitely one of my top stays in Vegas and probably where I'll book next when I go back."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,I stayed hear the week of September 26 2020!!The worst vacation I have ever had in my entire life!!!COVID-19 didn't help but Caesars Palace made it worst by 10 times!!!!!There is no house Keeping because of COVID-19!!!The hotel is filthy and A ton of Homeless people all over the outside  and inside of the hotelThe rooms are dirty and I don't recommend staying hear!!!Everyone is smoking weed and doing Heroine out side the hotel and on the strip!!!Definitely not a family oriented hotel!!!Cesar palace pools are not heated!!Ice cold poolsThis is the worst hotel in Vegas!!!The staff are rude!!!The slot machines are outdated!!!The restaurants are a rip off !!!Americana restaurant charges $25 per person for breakfast. The pizza place in Caesar Palace charges $43 for a 16 inch pizza with just cheese!!You will have to definitely leave the hotel to get cheaper food !!They lowered the room rates to $100 a night from $150 but the raised the food price up by 90 percent!!!Also the are so pet friendly that everyone is letting their dogs sleep in their beds at the hotel!!Remember next time u make love to your wife or Significant other. That a day or week before a Golden retriever slept in that bed!!!! If u  are Allergic to any pets that this may not be the place for you because everybody's sleeping with their animals.The only good thing was Margaritaville across the street for food !!!We have not seen any police in Las Vegas in 3 day !!So much crime !!U should carry a gun to protect yourself in Vegas!!!Will never return to Las Vegas!!!Absolutely disgusting!!!!If u love shooting up Heroin then Caesar Palace is for You!!!
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"Had a great stay at CP! It was our first time staying here and it did not disappoint. We stayed in the Augustus Tower which was very nice, our room was perfect and the bed was spectacularly comfortable! We had a great view of the Bellagio fountains which a nice treat.  As far as Covid precautions, I'd say they were doing a fine job. The mask police are EVERYWHERE in Vegas anyways (better put that mask over your nose!) and sanitizer stations were placed throughout the hotel and casino. I mean, if you're afraid of COVID you probably shouldn't be going to Vegas anyways but that's just my opinion  Overall, CP was great!! It's HUGE and really loved the restaurants, shopping and overall ambience."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"Visited Caesars Palace twice since they reopened and have been impressed both times.   I stayed in the Octavius Tower the 2nd time and everything was top notch.  Everyone was wearing masks and the employees were pro-active in making sure people were wearing them properly, even those who were smoking.  Once, I forgot to wear one coming down from my room and they quickly found one for me.  No judgement, no scolding, just working together to ensure everyone's safety.  The room was perfect, overlooking the pool.  A nice sofa and table made it easy to bring food back up to the room.  I saw some other reviews with pictures of scuffed and damaged furniture, but I saw none of that in my room.  Once I figured out the shortcut to casino behind the now defunct Bacchanal Buffet, it made trips to the car a little easier, but the parking garage is quit the walk as the Octavius Tower is on the other side of complex.I liked the markings in the elevator where to stand to attempt some sort of social distancing.  I liked that they had every slot machine turned on with small plaques encouraging social distancing.  This allowed couples to play together and your favorite machine wasn't turned off.  Caesar's always had great dealers and they didn't disappoint my last two trips.   The cards weren't working to my favor, but the dealers made it fun.   The servers seemed to be having challenges as orders took a long time, or never arrived.  I love their food court, especially during COVID-19 so meals are quick or taken back to your room.  Open until 11pm make late night snacks so convenient.  The self service check-in worked well as long as you didn't make the reservation on the same day, but I had to use the kiosk as the app wouldn't let me check in.   Checking out still required me to talk to someone at the front desk in order to apply reward credits.  I hope they'll add that function to the TV check out or self check out soon."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"Just spent 3 days at Caesars in a comped room!  They offered to upgrade to a suite for $200/night but that kind of defeats the purpose of a comped room.  They did upgrade us to the 47th floor, what he called the VIP floor of the Augustine Tower.  (There is a 48th floor, but that's the penthouse.)   I did ask for a fridge which they delivered in less than an hour for no charge.Room was great.  Nice view of the north strip.  Bed and pillows were super comfortable!  Jacuzzi tub was nice after a long day.  Only thing that didn't work was the Ethernet cable for the internet so had to use wireless, which isn't bad, just noteworthy.My only issue is the parking garage is a good walk depending on which tower you're in.   I like to have my car ready to go on a whim so I'm not a fan of valet as it takes too long to be impulsive.  The other thing is it's SOOOOO big, it can be a bit overwhelming.  Still, it's beautiful inside.  The dealers I had were all super friendly and helpful with tips, and I even did OK on the slots which everyone said are super tight.  I will definitely stay again assuming I get a comped room as I'm too cheap to actually pay for a room in Vegas.  Would rather spend money gaming or going to shows."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"Big bold fancy and nothing subtle about this place. Stayed few days with the kids. They loved it, pool was great very cold in the hot LV sun. Tried to social distance Best we could, but not everyone following safe guidances :(Ate at difara's pizza, which was best of the group of restaurants available.For pool, get there early to stake chairs under the tree shades if possible.Rooms are big and fancy, shampoo and soaps higher grade too.Cell phone signals are poor, without internet WiFi it won't work well. Despite the high resort fees, it was a great place to stay. Good place to go if you want to impress with the lux Vegas experience.Place is big, really big. You'll get lost many times and walk a lot."
Caesars Palace,Yelp,"Cool place fun but what I didn't like about Caesar Palace was the security. They are many men on the floor but security from people who can just take elevators to different floors of the building. My previous stay at MGM Grand, allowed you to access your floor with your keycard. Which provided a better ""peace of mind"". -Sha"
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"As soon as I walked in the door I was greeted by a concierge and was assisted with pre check-in and directed towards the NoMad's front desk. The front desk agent was very friendly and knowledgeable and was very thorough and detailed when explaining what the property had to offer, as well as what benefits/perks I would be receiving as an AMEX Fine Hotels & Resorts guest. The property recently reopened on September 30th and is the strip's first smoke free casino. My room was very spacious and had a view of the T-Mobile Arena and Allegiant Stadium (strip view would've been nice). I did notice the room was a bit dusty which I'm sure was due to no one staying at the property since it had been closed. Although some of the property's dining establishments remain closed, they do offer various choices. You get the feeling you're in an old New York building, which is pretty cool IMO. I definitely see myself staying here again and would recommend it to anyone looking for a room right on the strip."
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,Proscellings are tall rooms was fresh and clean staff was pretty friendly no casino at this hotelconsnot a standalone hotel rooms was just too warm.overall I am definitely going to come back
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"I've stayed at The Nomad Hotel a few times.  First off, let me just get this out of the way - it is very dark in the public spaces of the hotel!  The rooms I've stayed in though are nice and bright.  On each of my stays I had a Salon Double room.  I really like the size and layout of that room, the beds are very comfortable, the bathroom has two sinks, and there's no bathtub next to the bed :p  Btw the shower in the bathroom doesn't have a door and is half open - just know it can get a little cold because of that.The hotel doesn't have a lot of food options, but Park MGM does and it's just an exit door away from Nomad.  There's also The Park across the street and Aria right next door with more food and entertainment options as well.  Plus, it's not hard getting to hotels mid-Strip as you can take the tram from Park MGM to Bellagio.  The one bummer about Nomad is that it's not listed as a pick-up location on ride share apps.  You can go next door to Park MGM to get picked up, or text your driver to pick you up at Nomad and hope they go there rather than Park.  Overall though it's a nice hotel in a great location with very good service, and it has become one of my favorite places to stay at on the Strip."
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Valentine's Day weekend 2020 at The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas...YES PLEASE and THANK YOU!This boutique hotel is located on the top 4 floors of Park MGM.  Now if you have ever stayed at Park MGM, The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas is quite the upgrade.  Park is nice too, but NoMad is AMAZING.  From the hard wood floors, to the big comfy bed, to the stylish decor, this Vegas gem is well worth the upgrade and money.  The rooms are beautiful!The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas shares a casino, and several other amenities with Park MGM.  However, NoMad also has its own restaurant and pool.We had the best time at The Nomad this weekend, and will definitely be putting the NoMad into our Vegas Hotel rotation."
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"One of the definitions of ""nomad"" is an individual who roams about.  Surely, if I were a ""nomad"" visiting Las Vegas, I'd be willing to set my stay here in this hotel.  The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas is located in the upper floors of Park MGM (formerly Monte Carlo).  Its driveway is located on West Park Avenue off of either South Frank Sinatra Drive or South Las Vegas Boulevard.""Designed by French architect and designer Jacques Garcia, each of the 293 rooms and suites at NoMad Las Vegas are residential in feel and decorated in his timeless style with a distinct New York sensibility. Every room is appointed with custom furnishings, original artwork curated by Paris-based design studio be-poles, Bellino linens, and large flat screen TVs. Many rooms also feature freestanding pedestal bathtubs and separate water closets."" - NoMad websiteChecking in was very easy as the NoMad Hotel's lobby is separate from Park MGM.  Walking into the lobby, you could already feel a French luxury influence but not over-the-top Bougie or hoity toity.  We were greeted by Nadia at the front desk and she was so friendly and polite.  I provided my name and reservation confirmation number which she confirmed within a few seconds on her hotel system.   She then assigned us our room and keys while reminding us that for security reasons, we'd need to tap our room card in the elevator whenever we select our floor.We usually stay in M life properties whenever we're in Las Vegas because of convenience, services and value.  Our room was very comfortable but we only used our room for catching some needed ""shuteye"" after gambling the day or night away.   The room was decorated well but was bit small in comparison to rooms or suites that we've stayed in.  We did have a nightly issue with blaring music coming from South Las Vegas Blvd that didn't end until 3 AM.  We just endured it for 30 minutes to an hour as we were in our room by 2:00 AM - 2:30 AM.  Ahh, Las Vegas is a ""city that never sleeps"".The NoMad Hotel is connected by monorail to City Center and the Bellagio.  During the Spring/Summer, we'll usually ride the Aria Express tram (0.4 mile track) if we're needing to get to the intersection of Flamingo Road and Las Vegas Boulevard or during cooler Fall & Winter months, we'll walk it (about 1 mile, as the crow flies).  We rarely rent a vehicle whenever we visit this city as we we are willing and able to walk up and down The Strip even though we'll stop into casinos along the way.  However, being M life members has its benefits as we are at a tier that allows us to utilize the parking garage without charge with in-and-out privileges.We're already looking forward to returning to stay in this hotel."
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"MGM Resorts and Casino has been on a quest to expand and remodel their hotel portfolio in Las Vegas, starting in 2009 with the opening of a brand new hotel on Las Vegas strip the Aria Resort and Casino, followed by in 2014 The Delano Hotel makeover, what was once known as The Hotel, was its namesake implies inspired by South Beach with predominantly white walls and furniture, the opening of the new MGM's new concert and entertainment venue T-Mobile Arena, and now the total transformation of the uninspiring ""Monte Carlo Hotel""  into the hip and quirky MGM Park Las Vegas, tying up nicely with the arena.The NoMad takes off what was one of the best Las Vegas ""secrets"", Hotel 32, as in 32nd floor of the Monte Carlo Hotel, the NoMad boutique Hotel better known for their New York location, also London, UK, Los Angeles, and now Las Vegas, housed in a New York turn of the century Beaux Arts building with a distinctive over the top ritzy french decor.Nestled on the top floors of MGM Park, NoMad with  ""partnership"" with MGM Resorts, brings the same  sophistication to the NoMad Las Vegas, elegant and spacious with all the grandeur of the best european hotels.Interior designer Jacques Garcia was entrusted with the creation of NoMad Las Vegas, from the dimly lit and cozy waiting area, concierge, check in desk, restaurant and lounge, predominantly ruby red and green soft velour fabrics, marble floors, and wood accents, to the dedicated elevators, their stylish halls and chic rooms.The bedrooms are luxurious, elegant touches from bathroom and door hardware, turn of the century details like hexagonal tiles in the bathroom floor, marble countertops, Lefroy Brooks Ltd, classic british brassware, and leading Italian design handle manufacturer Valli e Valli, to the hidden bar and safe trunk, elegant soft velour fabric sofa, classic lamps, wood floors and persian rugs, MGM and Sydell group have made a great rendition of the original NoMad NYC. However there are some very annoying nuances with the NoMad, the air conditioner seems like it's on most of the time but doesn't seem to be able to keep the room cool, the decor is somewhat between a boudoir and a funeral home, and room charge is frustrating in sister MGM properties, I had several MGM employees argue with me about the existence of the hotel, which is one of the reason I disliked the whole experience. It appears, unknown to me or anyone else at the NoMad LV, guest profile is under Park MGM and not NoMad, absolutely ridiculous, MGM couldn't pay IT to add the damn NoMad to their hotel portfolio, which btw, you are not allowed to use Park MGM services like concierge while at the NoMad, and made even worse by the rudeness of just about everyone at Park MGM, which in my opinion fails in just about every aspect of hospitality."
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"We stayed here for a mini vacay. Initially, I thought I was staying at the Park MGM but upon checking in, I found out I was staying at the NoMad. We have stayed a number of times at the MGM Grand, so we were confident in our decision staying here. What I like is that they are centrally located on the Strip. Upon checking in, you are steered away from the hustle and bustle of the Park MGM and you are secluded away to a more posh, and more luxurious hotel. We lived our room and all the amenities. There's hardwood flooring throughout and it had a Victorian theme with crystal drinking glasses which was a welcoming touch compared to other hotels. The room was spacious with a fine view of the pool and some of the hotels surrounding the hotel. We were so pleased with how centrally located this hotel was. We've been to Vegas a number of times and we've been and seen most of the sights so the NoMad was perfect for all our excursions. NoMad will be on top of our list of places we'll stay if we come back!"
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"I was curious what it would be like to stay in a small hotel within a hotel so I booked our stay at the NoMad. Now I know. It's not that great.Upon arrival we really liked that the Nomad had its own separate valet area and lobby making check-in a breeze. Those are the only two things this hotel had going for it. I would venture to guess that having it's own pool might be a perk as well, but we didn't use the pool since our visit was in January. I had requested a classic king room but they upgraded us to the grand suite. I wish they hadn't because the layout of the 700 sq. ft. suite was bizarre and didn't suit us (pun intended). The only toilet in the room was located in the half bath by the front door. The bathroom in the bedroom only had a walk in shower and a sink. There was also a huge bathtub right next to the bed. I'm not sure why they spread out all the bathroom elements in this manner. Gotta pee at night? Gotta walk through the bedroom, the living room, and the foyer to get to the toilet! The next issue I had with our room was the noise. Our room overlooked the T-Mobile arena. They venue had music playing all day long outside in their plaza for no reason. It felt like our room was overlooking a pool. It made a daytime nap difficult. The room also had hardwood floors which design wise is a poor choice for a hotel. While it's aesthetically pleasing it doesn't do much to muffle noise. I could hear the people in the room above us dropping things, coughing, laughing and talking. Did I mention that was what woke me up at 7:45 am! If you plan to stay here pack earplugs.We also were involved in a hit and run incident just outside the hotel in which an MLife SUV driving recklessly aggressively cut off the Uber we were in & grazed the vehicle forcing the driver of our car to have to veer off the road. The MLife SUV did not stop. I was pretty shaken by the incident because watching come at me like that was scary. I was shook and my entire body tensed up and I was in physical pain after. I tried to report the incident to the Nomad hotel staff and security but they did absolutely nothing. Not one person even apologized to us. That's pretty much sums up what it will feel like to stay here. Expect zero service. Our room wasn't serviced whIle we were out, the complimentary coffee we were offered in the lobby was awful so pretty much this place was in  one word... underwhelming."
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"I always visit monte Carlo oh I mean park MGM every year I've visited a couple years ago on the day that hotel 32 closed its doors, I was very very very excited about the nomad I waited all year to come and visit thankfully on my birthday they gave me a room on the 32nd floor I had the opportunity to stay at Alltaier room , I really enjoy and appreciate the new design of the hotel but it leaves a lot to be desired as the Hotel 32 had MAGIC and a mystery about it , NoMad isn't as magical and feels dark... No more concierge's club on the 32nd floor no more beautiful art in the hallway on the 32nd floor in fact it looks like the old club lounge was turned into a room,, That was one of the best parts of staying at Hotel 32 is that you could go up to the club lounge and get water and small drinks and sodas the nomad has replaced it with this dark theme and traveling by myself I wasn't comfortable staying inside of the hotel lobby in the nomad, I felt unimportant , under-dressed and looked past , In fact I remember getting into the elevator and this couple was on the 30th floor and I was on the 32nd floor I press the button for them and then press my button and they looked at me and ""said who are you to be on 32?"" I thought it was rude, and that's the kind of people that come here, old rich fuddy duddies who wear fur and drink 30$ cocktails... Which is weird because I've been to even nicer properties and even better locations where the people were so kind and so gracious so it's definitely a brand problem.One last thought, you didn't recognize my Hotel Status or offer free late checkout , when I asked for 2PM your front desk told me it would be 150$  when I mentioned my status he said ""We are a different property and don't recognize other statuses"" .... so that needs to be fixed ASAP, and charging 150$ for an extra 2 hours just makes me laugh. Especially since your occupancy was only at 39% that night , so it's not like your housekeepers did have the time to do it,, like I said , this brand has a problem and I bet It won't remain long term. I give this hotel 6 years and counting before it's rebranded."
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"The top floors of Park MGM, similar vibe of their New York NoMad Hotel, dark, dimmed lighting, velvet curtains, red leather, and such.If you refer light, modern, simplicity design, and airy space, this won't do it for you.Comfortable beds, good bath products, suite, couch, table, large TV, a bar, etc.We are MLife member so our room was comped. Front desk was nice, their signature restaurant and bar are awesome. There's other restaurants here that you don't have to walk far for food and wine. Solid stay, we would stay here again."
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"My wife and I were offered a free weekend in a suite after we had a less than expected experience at the Park MGM so we decided to take them up on that offer this past weekend.  Talk about a completely different experience even though it's just 4 floors at the top of the Park.  It's like a different world here and in a good way.  The check-in process was seamless and the bellman gave a great tour of everything while bringing up our luggage.  The room was great, it had plenty of space, the curtains were blacked out and the beds were quite comfortable.  The bathroom was also well appointed.  In general, the hotel gives the feel of being smaller and more intimate than the massive casino hotels.  One complaint was the maid on the 30th floor who just opened up our door and walked in around 3pm in the afternoon without even knocking.  That was a bit suspicious and she didn't apologize even though we had the Do Not Disturb sign on the door.  Some training obviously needs to be done there.  We would return to this hotel."
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"My husband and I checked in on Feb 13 for a staycation to celebrate my birthday. Thor greeted us at valet and gave a great impression. He was warm and kind and so helpful, asking us what brought us to the hotel and if we were celebrating. Checking in was a breeze and took maybe a minute if that. Once my husband and I got to our room however, a housekeeper saw us opening our room door and said she had to quickly restock the mini bar. She took a few minutes while we stood there awkwardly and she finished. Or so we thought. A minute later when my husband and I are trying to settle in, she knocks AGAIN and says she forgot to do something else with the minibar, so again, we were interrupted. *sigh*  It threw us off because we're trying to have a romantic moment, you know? When she finally left again, we crossed our fingers that that was the last interruption. Which it was thank goodness. Onto the room. The room itself was lovely. We paid extra for the atelier room because I really wanted the freestanding bath tub in the room and you don't get that in the option before this and with the m life discount, it was a nice extra amount of savings. Everything in the room was clean and it was fairly quiet (I'll get to this later) and we were just below the top floor (32nd) in room 3121, a not too bad hike from the elevators. We loved the Las Vegas slippers and the robes were very fluffy and soft (much nicer than the Aria's scratchy robes). We had a view of the Excalibur hotel and the roller coaster which was fun to look at. Our biggest complaint however was noise throughout the night. There was an incessant beeping that occurred all throughout the night. I don't know what construction was going on outside the room but every minute or two we would hear ""BEEP BEEP BEEP"" and then it would stop and as soon as we felt relieved that it stopped, it would start back up again. We got back from our dinner at 930pm and it went on from then until 5am. We kept waking up from the sound and were so tempted to call the front desk and have our room switched but we knew we'd be leaving in the morning and we were just too exhausted to deal with packing up all our things. So our sleep was very poor. The Nomad store also closes way too early, I want to say 7pm, which we didn't expect because we tried to get snacks at 930pm and saw they had already closed. Bummer. At least MGM has a 24 hour convenience store. Overall our experience was okay. I loved the aesthetic the most. My birthday dinner at Nomad Restaurant was a little disappointing and upon checking out, we were told we couldn't get into our vehicle at the Nomad valet drop off because it was raining so we had to walk through MGM and go outside (in the rain) to the wait in line and pick up our vehicle. That was annoying because what's the point for paying for Nomad private valet when we have to go to MGM valet just because it's raining? Overall Nomad gave me a very sexy vibe with all the velvet, artwork, and dim lighting. Staff was pretty decent (especially Thor at valet and Isaac at Nomad Restaurant) and they gave us a complimentary one hour later check out time which was much appreciated since we barely slept. If they worked out a few kinks and maybe integrated more of their things with MGM, it would probably be a much more smooth process for their guests."
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"If you're looking for an upscale, vintage-chic hotel, then look no further than The NoMad Hotel. Thankfully, you do not have to walk a million miles through a casino to access the front desk if you use their valet. Upon check in, all guests are provided with bottles of Fiji water. The hotel rooms are located on the top four floors of the Park MGM (formerly the Monte Carlo), so it's a hotel within a hotel. Our room was on the tippy top - the 32nd floor. The NoMad Hotel has the most beautiful room key jackets I've ever seen. It was velvety and wine colored and it matched the Do Not Disturb sign. I thought it was a very nice touch.The room itself had a very a European feel to it. I have stayed at practically every noteworthy hotel on the Strip and felt that The NoMad Hotel's decor was unique and not your typical Vegas color scheme done in neutral hues. They incorporated color in a very elegant way and I absolutely loved it. Each piece of furniture looked as if it were handpicked. My faves were the hard-wood floors, the long purple couch, and the trunk-like dresser. My room did not have the bathtub that everyone raves about. I still enjoyed my spacious shower and the bathroom faucets that I believe were from London. Even the Aegean lotions and shower gels were amazing!  Lastly, the views in room 3223 were breathtaking!"
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,So i was nervous about this place cause I signed up through LHRC program. A friend gave me a review from who used the program 5 months ago and they had a bad experience. I am about to give an updated one because what i read from them and what I experienced are two very different experiences.The hotel ambiance is already fancy; a little darker when you walk in and it's quiet. I actually love that; not over crowed with people everywhere trying to check in and out. There was no line and i got serviced right away. They had everything prepared for me; starting with the welcoming letter to getting me an upgrade to a better room with great view and better beds. The rooms are beautiful and the view is right to the strip so you can see everything at night time when all the festivities happen. Service was excellent; they gave me details of everything i wanted to know and i cant say much negative things about the place. Location wise. Love that it is connected to the aria and you can go to bellagio using the tram. The only thing i would say is (and it's probably cause I'm part dyslectic) is that it is hard to find and navigate from nomad to the rest of the resort. You have to go into the lobby of park MGM and then turn to the guest. I feel like i get lost every time cause I'm thinking in my head there is a back way in. I highly recommend this place for sure!
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Service was 5 stars across the board in the nomad lounge! We sat at the bar and service couldn't have been more attentive! Really great energy and great vibes from every employee working here. We ordered a couple dishes as tasters to check out the menu. The humdog is just wow! Glorified hot dog is the best way to describe it! Worth trying? Oh yea! Don't like hot dogs, still try this! I bet you'll like it. We also ordered this fried chicken appetizer and one of our fat fried pieces was almost completely raw on the inside, but the moment we brought it to their attention, they immediately remade a new batch yummier and better than before! I refuse to knock off any stars for that event simply because they handled the situation with grace and promptness! The exact way any establishment should react when something like this occurs! Accidents happen, but the execution of every aspect matters when it comes to a good review, in my opinion. Can't wait for the restaurant side to open up. If these little plates were that flavorful, then I can't wait to see what the menu has featured!"
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Olivia might possibly be the single best customer experience in Las Vegas. I was not expecting such a warm welcome. The has the perfect phone voice too. The way Olivia talks is enchanting and makes you feel like you're the most important person in the universe.  Where do I get one? As for the hotel, it's elegantly Gothic on the darker end of Art Deco. I feel like I'm staying in Bruce Wayne's guest room. The name NoMad doesn't reflect the decor and why is it spelled like that? They should seriously consider renaming the place to Hotel Olivia!!!"
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Hotel is unique!  Love the setting of the bathtub beside the bed, toilet and shower in both sides of the room. The flush and light switches was old fashioned. Felt like staying in Europe vs Vegas. Loved the feel! Will definitely stay again!"
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"This is for the bar in the High Limit room attached to the NoMad in the Park MGM Hotel. First off, you don't need to be playing any high limits to drink here.But more importantly, the bartenders, Yong and Scott, were awesome! They mixed great drinks for our group and provided just the right level of bartender banter to keep the party going! Thanks guys for a great night!"
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"I attended Shankminds in Las Vegas, and Park MGM was the official hotel for the event, and they upgraded all of us to The NoMad.  When I made my reservation, I asked for a towel octopus to be placed in my room, and it was waiting for me when I checked in! The front desk looked at me strangely when I asked them to send someone to empty the minibar. They said they'd never received that request before, but they did it. The bed was quite comfortable, but the ""desk"" was nothing more than a small round table. I ended up using the vanity in the bathroom when I needed to work on my computer. The divided bathroom was weird - water closet/toilet near the front door, giant tub in the bedroom, and a shower and sink in the bathroom. Does anyone actually use the giant tub? It seemed like the room had many ""perks"" that I did not need or want. Overall, it was a fine place to base my life for a few days. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable. I appreciated that it was located only 1.7 miles from the Welcome to Las Vegas sign which I ran to early one morning."
The NoMad Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"The NoMad is a New York-inspired boutique hotel atop the newly renovated Park MGM casino (formerly known as the Monte Carlo). You share the same elevator banks with the Park MGM, with the only exception being that the NoMad occupies the upper floors of the building. There's also a dedicated check-in area with lots of friendly, attentive staff; the ambience is dark, plush, and velvety - something that extends to your velvet keycard folders and to your room itself.As for the rooms, they're not terribly different from those of any major hotel chain, except for a distinctly boutiquish, curated feel to all the furniture, artwork, and fixtures. When combined with hardwood floors and rugs throughout, you feel as if you're in a New York brownstone apartment instead of a large Vegas casino.All in all, a nice way to embed a boutiquish hotel within a much larger hotel. This won't be the trendiest or most luxe choice out there on the Strip, but if you can snag a reasonable rate, it's a good, value-oriented, and even somewhat sophisticated choice."
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"This casino was beautiful and big. There were so many stores and dining options to choose from.  The slots were fun and not as tight as the strip.  The pool area was awesome.  A bit of advice,  go to the pool as soon as it opens to get a spot and you can go in and out all day and have somewhere to sit. There were a lot of smaller pools so it was less crowded than a giant pool."
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"Open for business! They allow you to use any entrance. The minute you get to the door (contactless) a staff member opens the door for you entering and exiting. Then they have you step to the side for a thermal temperature check before allowing you to enter.The slot/video poker machines had 3 chairs for a row of 5 machines. Two problems here: 1st this in itself does not allow for a 6 ft spread and 2nd the customers who don't care just pull a chair from the other side if they want.ALL STAFF WERE WEARING MASKS AT ALL TIMES DURING MY 4 DAY VISIT!! The resort had wet sanitizing wipes available all over the place, including every floor at the elevators, so you could use the wipe to tap the up/down buttons as well as what floor once you step inside.  They have signs that no more than 4 people allowed per elevator... the problem with this is that I'm not going to step into an elevator wearing my mask with 3 people who are not! If I was at the elevator first and there were people without a mask I simply asked them if they could catch the next elevator. If they made a big deal out of it then I stepped out and just caught the next one myself.The coffee shop did a fantastic job of social distancing as well as friendly, efficient and reasonable prices.It appeared maybe less than half the customers chose to wear a mask. It did amaze me that each time I stepped into the restroom and was washing my hands at one of the 8 sinks available that, with only one other person there, they would come to the sink immediately next to me without a mask. Seriously!Red Rock is a large resort and I could walk around freely and keep a social distance as well.Our room was clean (except for one corner of the shower which had mold). We had Xtra towels, soap etc brought up upon check-in and then chose no housekeeping during our stay. That was perfect! My favorite part was that they did not have the refrigerator being used with the stupid little alcohol bottles (that if you touch you owe like a million dollars$$$). This meant that we were able to use the refrigerator for all our bottled waters.. much better!*** Overall I would say the resort/staff/management did a very good good job during these tough times I was very comfortable here except when crossing paths every now and then with disrespectful customers that is no fault of the resort.Thank you Red Rock for an enjoyable few days after 90 days of mostly stay at home."
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"This place is deplorable. When I told assisant manager ""Eric"" exactly what my concerns were,  his response was:  ""I don't know what you want me to do.  I helped you with the elevator... ""I booked a room with a view of the mountains, I got a view of the parking lot. I was told to park in whichever parking lot I wanted and ended up walking 15 mins with all my luggage to front desk. The front desk rep saw I was exhausted and then proceeded to give me the furthest away room from the elevators. The elevators only work with your key card, which by the way, your key card doesn't work.I then found that lovely dried clump of hair stuck to the bathroom door of my so called  ""cleaned"" room. The room filled up with smoke from midnight onwards and we couldn't breathe or even sleep. Finally in the morning I waited 15 minutes for the elevator, which the so called assistant manager ""helped"" with because the key card wasn't working. Oh and not even a ""So sorry you has to wait... "", just ""what's happenin...""So as I was telling Eric at the front desk (underpaid I know, since I used to do that very job) he just said ""dunno what you want me to do... "" then eventually ""sorry"" with a shrug. See Eric, that's what you start with. Oh and Red Rock, let's train your staff with the knowledge of what kind of filter you use.  Since that's been one of the biggest changes in commercial buildings since covid. Disgusting place,  horrible customer service."
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"Be prepared to get yelled at for not knowing the procedure for entering this casino even if you have a mask on!!! You are yelled at for going in not stopping on the dot and getting your temp check. First time in here since Lockdown. Be sure to walk in, listening and staring at the floor for the stupid FOT!! My friend and I were going in with her kids while having a conversation. When their Eric the Mgr came out per our request we explained that the worker never said please or excuse me in any professional or polite manner. Once we asked for him she began saying please and thank you."
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,We are currently staying at Red rock casino.  The staff is overwhelmed with the amount of people . The spa was closed for two days unexpectedly with no reason and no opportunity to rebook.  The pool has very limited staff and almost no service.
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"My favorite off strip casino. This, along with Green Valley Station, are Station Casinos premier resorts. The aesthetic here is very opulent and modern. The casino is always bright and welcoming and there are tons of things to do.For gamblers you have what seems to be thousands of slots and video poker machines. There are also tons of table games with varying minimum bets. So be prepared to drop some money if you want to play here. For those who don't gamble there is a Regal movie theater with different types of screens including 3D screens and screens with those cool chairs that rumble and move when there is action on the screen.Tons of restaurants to choose from: southern bbq, ramen, steak house and American. And an accompanying food court for those of us who want something a little more casual.There is an arcade for children and every well mentioned bowling alley.The place is a short walk to the Downtown Summerlin shopping center and located across the street from the new Aviators ballpark. I've never had a problem finding parking and the covered parking is a few stories high, so in the head you can find some solace from the sun.Make sure you sign up for a players card on your first visit. Players earn points they can use towards the buffet and rooms."
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,Stayed two nights recently and enjoyed it very much. Very good Covid procedures. Staff is great. Rooms very nice. Great bathrooms. Has a good range of resto choices on site and there are many more close by. Casino is nice as well. Due to Covid you must either sit and order food if you want to drink or get served while you are gambling. Not the resorts fault blame your local politicians!  Definitely will stay here again.
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"Definitely torn about this review. We were definitely happy with how nice the room was and with the amenities. We had some good moments on our staycation but we're unhappy about a couple things as well.  First we are locals but still we're charged the resort fee, even though they specifically advertise they will waive resort fees for locals. Was told I ""didn't book the right deal"". There were additional room fees no doubt due to covid, but there was something called ""room turn down fee"". Frustrating as this wasn't advertised when we booked.Also, there didn't appear to be social distancing at red rock whatsoever. People were literally on top of each other literally everywhere: slot machines, restaurants, sports book, pool. Masks were enforced just not social distancing. Overall just an OK experience. At these prices you definitely expect more. Would've been nice to not have any ""hidden"" fees, so be careful on that when you book. And if you go on weekends prepare for social distancing not being enforced."
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"What can you expect when the Red Rock (and other Station's casinos) re-open? As of today, casinos just got the nod from Gov. Sisolak to re-open on June 4.  Caesars and the Flamingo are likely to be among the firsts on the Strip to re-open, but they're all gearing up.  The Red Rock Casino will be among the first of the Station's casinos to open.***TEMPERATURE CHECKS***Expect to have your temperature taken before you enter!  The entrance will have roped lines, similar to what you'd find at an airport.  Security will scan you from afar with a thermal scanner.  They'll ask you to stand at a designated spot and within seconds, before you even realize it, it's done.  Totally painless!  No temperature gun or anything intimidating.  However, if your temperature is above 100.4 you will NOT be permitted entry.  There will be a waiting area for you to sit and relax in before you get it re-checked.  It can be pretty darn hot in Las Vegas, so if you were rushing in the heat to get inside, they'll give you some time to ""cool down"" before re-taking your temperature.  I believe casinos will be sharing ​this information with other casinos, so don't think you can do an end-run​ around this by casino​-hopping if you have a fever.  Employees will also be required to undergo temperature checks.  ***SOCIAL DISTANCING***  This will be enforced at the slot machines.   Check out my photos for a preview of the social distance seatings at the slot machines.  These are now pre-arranged and ready to go.  Moving forward, a side-by-side bank of 5 slot machines will only seat three​, and ​a side-by-side bank of 3 machines will only seat 2.  ***MASKS***Masks will be required for employees and suggested to be worn by guests.***SMOKING***Smoking will continue to be allowed, despite pleas to disallow this.Don't expect all shops, bars or eateries to be fully open just yet.  Casinos will be gaging business before launching a 100% re-opening​.I'm glad to see firsthand that Station's is taking health precautions seriously.   I've always enjoyed the brand of the Station's casinos.  They're clean, well-kept,​ and have a lively vibe.  Good luck to Station's and all the Vegas casinos for a successful June 4 and beyond re-opening!!    #VegasRising #VegasStrong"
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"This is my favorite locals' casino. It's a part of the large chain of Station Casinos, located throughout the Las Vegas Valley.  Interestingly, Station Casinos is also the owner of the Graton Casino in Northern California.  Located in Summerlin, this is a modern casino that's more than a casino.  There's a nice huge movie cinema attached to the casino that I frequent often.  You'll also find a bowling alley here.  I'm not a bowler,  but I've seen it, and it's super huge with mega lanes.  There's also a selection of both higher end and casual restaurants.  In fact, the famous Blue Ribbon Sushi, based out of New York City, just opened a branch here.  It recently relocated from the Strip into the Red Rock. Obviously, there's a huge casino inside the Red Rock, coupled with a large Bingo room as well.  However, unless you enjoy donating to the Las Vegas economy via your gambling losses, I'd say pass.  There are infinite amount of ways I'd prefer to spend my money, which I value immensely, and parting with it in this manner isn't one of them!Should you opt to book a hotel room, know that there's a very nice modern pool area, which is about as nice as any you'd find at the Strip hotels. The once reasonable rates, though,have since skyrocketed significantly in the past year, since the inception of Downtown Summerlin, right next door. Red Rock is a great place where you can easily spend a few hours gambling, dining, at the Sports Book, or relaxing at one the lounges.  It's a nice changeover from the Strip, and locals love it."
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"This place is simply WONDERFUL. It's clean and classy, huge, and away from the strip! My fiance and I have yet to stay at the hotel for a staycation sometime, but we love that there's so many forms of entertainment here (bowling, arcades, movie theater) as well as a classy bingo area!! The staff is also sweet, welcoming/inviting and helpful. They have a buffet, but it's not open yet thanks to COVID-19..They have the usual tables as well as $1 electric blackjack and bubble craps, but they also have live roulette and blackjack for electronic tables as well. So cool!Free self park in their giant parking garage as well as self-park lots.We have yet to try more restaurants, but love that they have both restaurants, desserts, and food courts as well. We love coming here and will be coming back many a times! :)"
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"So we come to check in and we notice the security door lock is hanging on the last screw. We're locals here and we're trying to help our local casino out but this is absolutely unacceptable. I don't feel safe in this room and I have no idea why they had to bust this door down to get in this room.Update: changed it to five stars. After speaking with the manager and explaining our case, he decided to upgrade our room for us. It took a little bit to get him to do it, but he did it."
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"Don't stay here during COVID. Or maybe any other time. Almost zero mask enforcement with probably 30-40% of guests not wearing one. In the casino, by the pool, even in small spaces like elevators. I had to be in Vegas for work and this property feels incredibly unsafe for anyone, but especially for me at 7 months pregnant. So I was stuck in the room most of the time, and the refrigerator was locked. I called the front desk and they apologized and had us move rooms. But in the new room...the refrigerator was also locked. They THEN said oh it's a COVID safety issue and we can't unlock any refrigerators. This was after we packed and moved our stuff 7 floors. Also, the pool service is terrible. We tried to sit outside responsibly in masks 6 feet from other guests to get a break from the stale air and smoke, and waited two hours to be able to track down a server. Seriously, imagine a 7 month pregnant baked potato in the 110 degree Vegas heat, dodging maskholes, trying desperately just to get a cold drink. It wasn't pretty."
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"This hotel is fabulous..... the scenery is absolutely beautiful with the Red Rock Mountains in view. The rooms are luxurious and bathrooms are WOW! I love the restaurants, Tbone was so gorgeous and the food was delicious. We met a friend here to celebrate his 91st birthday couldn't ask for a more beautiful place to eat and the food was unbelievable! The hotel staff are all so friendly and very helpful The location is the best!!!! ...your away from all the hustle of the strip... but don't worry there is plenty to do at this beautiful resort!"
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"From Hero to ZeroI used to work here 10 years ago and I remember being hammered on service here. It was imperative to provide guests with the absolute best customer service possible and ensure their stay is the best it could possibly be. So as I decided to book a staycation with my wife for the week I picked to stay here thinking that we would be granted that very same service I gave guests years ago. WRONG.Was it a terrible experience? No. But was it excellent and diamond status? No. Blue Ribbon Sushi for dinner was extremely disappointing. Service was horrendous for the price and style of the restaurant. (See my review of Blue Ribbon Sushi for more details)The pool was the best part of the stay. The cabana was clean, the staff was extremely attentive, and we had a great day out there.However, this is when the mood shifts. Our room was supplied with one roll of toilet paper for a multiple night stay. So knowing that would not be enough we ordered another roll from the staff in the halls and waited...and waited....and waited until we had to go to the bathroom again and forced us to use tissues in order to go. I then had to go to the concierge personally to ask for them to send more toilet paper up to the room. I feel like that is a ridiculous thing to have to do at a resort of this status. Furthermore, we were staying on the 18th floor which what we found to be directly under the suites above us. The suites have all tile flooring which echos sounds like you would not believe. However on this special night, we had young girls above us screaming, stomping their feet and blasting music so loud our room was shaking and it sounded as if we had a speaker placed in our room connected to their music. This went on until midnight when we finally decided we wanted to get some sleep. So we made a call to the desk to see if they would implement some form of noise policy. We waited...and waited...and waited again. Got to the point where we actually packed our stuff up and were just going to go back home at 1:30 am and leave the hotel for good. Again, that's a ridiculous experience of a resort of this quality. So as I stated before, this property went from a diamond in the rough off the strip, to exactly what you would expect of a hotel off the strip in Vegas. Won't be staying here again with so many other choices in Vegas or at least until I hear some positive reviews coming out of this place again. Disappointed overall"
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"Funny the response says, ""we are here for you"". I was talking with a manager. He wasn't there for me, he's the one that caused all the grief. So who is here for me?"
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"Back in late March February-ish red rock casino sent out a notification saying that we would not lose our status or level on our membership card.They usually zero you out come June and December but because of the virus they said they wouldn't.They did it anyway :(The manager at the rewards desk was giving me the BS corporate talk. He knew exactly what I was talking about but chose to play dumb. He says, show me the email. Who saves a casino email from March?... and he conveniently adds, oh the computer is down. What a crock. The lady before was just handling everything perfectly.I hate when they lieI was so close to becoming chairman and now I see that I'm on the bottom level.Well thank goodness there's plenty of other casinos to play at.Shame on you red rock."
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"Downgrading the Red Rock.  We've been going here for the past 3 years as our go-to entertainment spot and the service in the casino bars has gone down hill.  Last night 9/12/18 7pm-ish, at the Lucky Bar a male bartender couldn't have been more arrogant and rude. Not a clue about good bar hospitality.  Because of him we left for good. It was the straw.  On to the Palms :)Love, love, love this place.   The atmosphere is excellent. Tastefully done. The house music is audible, not just back noise adding to noise. They play popular songs.Every staff member I've had contact with has been top notch professional. (except spa. see below)The slot games seem to pay out better than most casinos we've played at :) The restaurant selection is good though I wish they had a better Mexican rest. Parking is never a problem.Restrooms are always clean and stocked.Movie theater, bowling... One stop fun day.  Movie theater is well maintained. On Wednesdays they offer $4 movie tix to the over 55 crowd for the matinee. Haven't gone bowling yet but it looks nice from the door.Have not experienced a nights stay so I can't comment on the hotel but have peeked out around the pool area and that looks inviting.Did pop my head in the Spa area to check it out for future Girls Day out and was somewhat disappointed. Stood at the front desk while 4 employees stood around at the one end of the desk. Stood there long enough to hear an ear full before one of the younger girls asked if she could help me, she seemed sweet. Of what I overheard it was a bitch session. JUST what someone whats to hear as they enter a RELAXING SPA. That would be bad management given I believe one of them was."
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,We were really happy with our stay at the Red Rock Resort.  We are a family of 4 and enjoyed a very clean modern room overlooking the red rock mountains and pool side.  We had in room dining which was great and at night it was quiet.  I have to mention that waking up to the beautiful mountains views was very memorable.  We loved it
Red Rock Casino Resort And Spa,Yelp,"I waited to make this review until I could cool down a bit from anger. I wanted to give this place a fair review. We decided to take advantage of the staycation promotion they were advertising. My girlfriend is a local and it was her birthday so I figured we would splurge for a night. The hotel was nice... nothing really special to write about. The rooms are nice and big. The elevators smelled like someone got too drunk and urinated all over them and the hallway.  We went to dinner at Osteria, it was wonderful. We used the pool, it was relaxing. I forgot my phone in the car and the valet was awesome and ran to get it for me. The amount of drunk people running through the halls screaming at all hours of the night is what it is and the risk you take staying at a casino. We had ordered room service the night before. For 10 am. So we could finally sleep in.  The total on the screen was $46. Pricey for two breakfasts but again it is what it is. Then comes the morning.... 9 am and there is a knock on the door. It was our breakfast. Half asleep I get out of bed realize I'm not decent ... throw on a robe. The man walks in with the breakfast. Hands me the check, I sign, give him a $5 tip. I was confused by the total which said $79. I figured id ask about it at check out. But I'm naked half asleep and flustered that breakfast came an hour early. So we get up, I got down to get coffee ... Starbucks line took us 45 minutes ... got back to our cold breakfast... discovered there wasn't any utensils to eat with. I called house keeping... they argued that I didn't order breakfast... I said I did ... they finally found my order... an hour and 20 minutes have now passed and it's finally time to eat ... obviously everything was freezing. We ate it. We sat in the beautiful tub until check out which we extended until 2 for $50. Come time for check out ... I see that breakfast cost me $80.... $80 freaking dollars.... my cold breakfast. Come to find out, they include tip in their prices which is a mark up of about 25%. There are a bunch of other hidden fees with room service that are not laid out in the check you sign (nor the thing on the tv) that comes to the room. The only thing it says is $79. No detailed receipt that actually shows what I'm paying for. So on top of the tip that's already included, they ask for another tip. Which I gave in the amount of $5. Because again, flustered... I see a tip line. I put something there. Come to find out they took it upon themselves to give themselves $15.  So when I went to check out I questioned the man checking us out. I asked for a detailed receipt. He went back to speak to a manager 3 times, instead of the manager just coming up to speak to me and handling it. Instead they chose to have me hold up the line of people who are now getting frustrated because they can't check in. The young man taking care of us at the front wasn't the most knowledgeable. Its not his fault, his manager should've known better but I knew I'd get no where with him. I asked multiple times for a detailed receipt so I knew what I was paying for... he again handed me the receipt with just a total on it. At this time it's been 40 minutes. People behind me were aggravated ... so I called it a wash and left.... what should have been a relaxing weekend left me angry. I won't ever return to this hotel because of how shady and unprofessional they acted."
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"1 - 50% of all rooms - including corner suites - face the busy I-15 freeway.  Widows are not that soundproof - you will hear trucks all night. The view you paid extra for are the industrial parks (see photo)2 - Their website has an error that changes your desired reservation date to the date you book. If you are not careful, you lose your reservation - front desk person who checked us in (was very nice) and told us ""it happens all the time."" And then they charge you $100 more/night because you're now ""booking at the last minute"" and ""we can charge more for that room to someone else""  (direct quotes from the manager)A little background - I booked this place to get a suite with a separate door to the bedroom - something that is very hard to find in strip hotels. The photos make everything look really nice, but most of the furnishings are run down. Kitchens have no utensils, plates, glassware - nothing. Bed mattress was lumpy.  I had moved from the Wynn hotel that week and really wished I hadn't.  So very unhappy at the Vdara."
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"When I go to Vegas, I always stay at the Aria now. Next to the Aria on one side and the Bellagio on the other is the Vdara Hotel and Spa. The Vdara a condo-hotel. It is in the City Center area on the Las Vegas Strip. Since I was staying so close I had to go check it out. Here is a quick tip, I was staying at the Aria and wanted to go to the Bellagio. There is a monorail that goes from the Aria to the Bellagio. If you want to walk to the Bellagio and go down to the strip, it's a long walk to get to the Strip, go north on it and then walk up the the Bellagio. I walked out the Aria, walked across the street to the Vdara, cut through the Vdara and there you are a short walk to the Bellagio. It's quicker than going down to the Strip and walking and quicker than the monorail unless you lucky enough to catch the tram in the Aria station when you get there. The coolest this is Fetch and Jett, these guys are robots. They deliver snacks, spa products, coffee, soda and stuff like that. If I ever stay there I will get a robot to deliver like maybe drinks from the bar. So the Vdara opened in December 1st 2009 and is 57 stories tall with 1,495 suites. It has a huge two floor spa and fitness center, a market and one bar. The bar is in the lobby and has a very nice and comfortable outdoor seating area. I stop in and got a drink and the bartender was really nice and friendly. As with all the bars in the City Center area, they are a little pricy, but it's nice anyway. It has a 40,000 square foot pool and pool deck area. So, there was a problem at first on the pool deck area. I'm not sure if they took care of it or not but I read about this shortly after it opened. The hotel reflective surface causes the pool and deck area to have extreme heat conditions. The V in Vdara stands for Vegas, sorry not sure what the dara stands for. Here is how it works. The suites there are sold as private residences. The owners can participate in a rental program  to lease their condos back as hotel rooms. When they are not using it. Seems like a decent investment. This is a super nice complex in a great location and believe it or not a lot of people prefer a place to stay without a casino. Your literally a  hundred yards or so from either the Aria or the Bellagio so there's your places to gamble. The unsold condos are rented out as hotel rooms. These are managed by MGM. It received its first AAA Four Diamond Award in 2011. So it's a great place. This is a super nice place in a great location."
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,Decided to extend my trip to Vegas so I used myVEGAS rewards to book a studio room at Vdara since I've never stayed before. The lady at the front desk was very friendly and even gave me an awesome upgrade to a fountain view room! Loved the modern decor and the view was just incredible. The only negative was that many amenities are closed on weekdays. Would definitely stay again!
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"This was my second time staying here for a mini staycation. Valet and bell desk staff were friendly and quick to assist us getting our luggage to the room after checking in. The hotel itself is clean and I find it quieter than an lot of the others. We were upgraded to a suite on arrival, which offered us more space, as well as a small kitchen area which was great for a light breakfast. The city center area is nice to walk through. Very bright and modern with some great restaurants to chose from, without having to venture too far from the hotel every night.Would definitely stay at Vdara again."
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"I stayed Vdara hotel because my friend works this hotel.I got upgraded to Deluxe Suite Room, stayed by myself !!!!!!!!Nice Bellagio Water Fountain view, and there was a big Bathtub.I hated Resort fee for what ? I didn't use any local phone or anything, $45/ night.But this is Law in Las Vegas now.I enjoyed at Vdara hotel easy to access to another hotel with walking distance.Outstanding Housekeeping service.Housemaid always took care of my room."
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,Amazing birthday with friend the best suite best costumer service love it I was lucky to be able to reserve two suites that communicate something unique .
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"With so many places and options to stay at in Vegas, don't spend your money here. You can spend your money on literally one million different things in Vegas, bad hospitality shouldn't be one of them. Stayed here for business and was immediately disappointed. The mattress in my room was completely sunk in, but due to my later check in, maintenance was gone and there was ""nothing they could do"". The restroom vanity light was completely broken, and the restroom tiles need replacement. Don't get me wrong, it's a very nice room with clean sheets and all the spritz and sparkles. But for almost $300 dollars a night - you could get much better elsewhere. I decided to put up with the sunken in mattress but what got me was the hours of the amenities. You pay $50 dollars PER DAY for a pool that closes at 5pm and a gym that closes at 6pm. Yes, you're reading this right - SIX PM. The sun isn't even down at this time! With me being in Vegas for work, my meetings weren't over till five, so what's the resort fee for?! Anyways, staff handled the situation terribly and to make matters just that much worse, navigation to get to and from the resort is extremely complicated. I'm an average navigator and I was lost. Pretty sure Christopher Columbus would even have trouble getting in and out. Uber's and LYFTS take double the time and oh $30 bucks for parking. Per night."
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"I was extremely disappointed with the service at the pool. The pool closes at 5p which is a big disappointment!! Requested a day bed and it LITERALLY Took the staff 20 minutes to seat me. There seemed to be some confusion on the order. I finally am walked to the day bed it was stained and the host covered it with towels. Since I already the unsightly stains I was not comfortable touching the pillow because surely that was stained as well. The host indicated the someone would be over with a fresh fruit plate and to enjoy my time. A whole 1.5 hours later, not one waitress came to check on me. Ironically the couple next to me had constant service. No fruit, no water, no cocktail. At this point my daughter is fussy and my husband goes to the bar for another 15 minute wait.  We now walk away and have to return to the room to feed her because no service had been provided or offered. They finally send someone over due to my husband commenting at the bar that there had been no daybed service. They send someone over 7 minutes later for them to say oh the kitchen is closed. Another host finally comes over with a pitcher of water and some cups count it...two whole hours being at the pool. At this point we are wrapping up our pool time hungry, thirsty, and feeling unwelcomed. Based on this experience I was ready to check out of the hotel and could not recommend or return."
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"The Vdara never disappoints me! This is my go to hotel whenever I'm in Las Vegas. The Vdara is chic, clean and simply amazing. I see what it's a 5 star hotel! Can't wait for more future visits!"
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"I stayed at the Vdara for the weekend (Aug.19-Aug.21) to celebrate my 21st birthday. I ABSOLUTELY loved the hotel. My friends and I had the Executive Corner Suite. The room was amazing. It was very spacious, clean and the view was incredible. Not to mention, I had a little trouble checking in the hotel but thanks to Terrance, he was able to make everything work out. He was super friendly and helpful. I will be back for Spring Break."
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"The last few times we were in Vegas we chose to stay at Aria Sky Suites which is Vdara sister hotel next door. It's been a while since we stayed at Vdara and I remembered I liked our hotel stay here. The one bedroom two story loft suite we stayed this time was quite spacious and comfortable. It's on the highest floor so it was very quiet which I liked a lot. Still liked the modern contemporary style of this hotel. The views from downstairs living room and upstairs loft bedroom were nice. But the view from the master bathroom was horrible, it was a ugly roof looked like the roof in ""Hangover"" movie! But it was also funny in some way! Well, at least hubby arranged red rose pedals to make everything look romantic and cute. I would have preferred pink roses but hubby said they didn't have pink ones! Loved the small Grey Goose (my favorite) and fresh fruits though! The suite was functional and comfy with all the nice amenities we needed. Wet bar had decent beverages and alcohol selections, limited snacks too. We went to the spa for customized facial & massage and they were very nice. Gym and smoothie bar were on spa level too, had a green smoothie which was super sour. Pool is small at Vdara but less crowded and much quieter. Lobby lounge is my all time favorite, beautiful patio is next to a small dog park. The super friendly mixologist Todd made me the most delicious cocktails everyday, he was amazing! It's a short walk to Bellagio and tram, Aria is just next door so it's a convenient location to a lot of places nearby. This hotel has a dog park and kids friendly cause there is no casino or smoke here.  Hubby booked VIP arrival and transportations cause we flew in this time. The transportations were hassle & stress free, our limo drivers arrived right on time and provided friendly services on both arrival and departure. VIP arrival had someone check in for us so it was sufficient too. I really appreciated the top notch services Vdara provided. Everything went smoothly and all the staff members were very accommodating and pleasant the entire time! Vdara never disappoints!Ps. MGM has started to charge more resort fees, it was $52 per day at Vdara, and it's more than most same luxury hotels in Vegas."
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"When it comes to hotel stays in Vegas, luxury big suite with nice views is the most important to us. we don't smoke and gamble, so we always try to stay at smoking and casino free hotels. We go to Vegas a few times a year to do weekend getaways or special occasions, nice dinners, drinks, shopping, parties, sexy times in our suite all day or all night. Vdara provided all the things I need! No complaints! One of the newest hotel & spa in Vegas, located in city center, sister hotel of Aria. The entire hotel is Euro style modern contemporary, I like it a lot, very short walking distance to Aria and Bellagio. Best part of this hotel is that it is smoking and casino FREE! I am very allergic and sensitive to cigarettes, I hate smoking, after a long walk in any casinos, I can smell smoke in my hair and skin, it makes me sick! But here at Vdara, I can totally relax, the air is sooo fresh, it actually smells like cookie! very sweet. :) They provide free Wi-Fi, it came very handy with our ipad 2 use there. My experience at Vdara was very pleasant and satisfied. the service was over the top! From valet, bell service, front desk to housekeeping, never once we got a below average service, everybody was very friendly and helpful, they answer all your questions pleasantly with big smiles, and did a little chat with us here and there. our luggage guy was a very pretty blonde girl, how interesting!. The lobby is not big, there is a market store located in the lobby. it is so convenient to get some drinks, snacks, food, wine, beer or whatever you need on you trip. And bar Vdara, they have nice specialty cocktails n light fare. We had an executive corner suite at 50th floor, its a bit of long walk from the elevator, but it was worth it, the suite was big, nearly 850 sf., full kitchen, living room with windows from entrance door all the way to bedroom door, imagine the amazing view we got! A dining table, an extra powder room, bedroom with comfy king bed, big closet with safe, and a huge bathroom with the entire view of city center, soaking bathtub is right next to the window, I took a bubble bath with an amazing view every night. :) Don't worry about the sun light hurting eyes, they have shades cover all the windows of the entire suite, there is a few control panels, you can control however you want your shades to cover, even make it blackout :) What I love the most about our suite is that it has so many floor to ceiling windows!  Almost the entire right side of the ""walls"" are actually windows, even the bathroom has windows and amazing views, just add Champagne, roses, chocolate and bubbles, a romantic intimate evening is all set! I really enjoyed our 4 nights stay at Vdara the past holiday weekend, and I especially want to thank housekeeping, I have a lot of things when I travel, they made everything clean and perfect in my suite, even put my shoes in order, that was very nice of them. :) In my opinion, the staffs provide good service to everybody, hubby travels so much, he always gives more tips, do that we get better service, he tipped $10 on housekeeping everyday, maybe that's why I had my things all organized the entire weekend, smart :) Vdara now is my favorite hotel stay in Vegas, will stay there again and again, will try other bigger suite next time, panoramic suite is a very nice choice. :) The rates are a little more expensive than some of the top hotels in Vegas, especially on holiday weekends, Saturday night on Labor day weekend was $400 for our executive corner suite, but the studio suite rates are much cheaper, sign up their email list, you get special offers from time to time. Ps. I love their bathroom so much! You don't see too many bathroom with views in Vegas. Beautiful tub with beautiful Vegas skyline and city center view, bubble bath with Champagne every night!"
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,Offered a good rate here? Don't bite. This place is a disaster right now (Covid times). Trash everywhere and our room smells like sewage (the first room we checked into smelled like chain smokers had stayed there....in this non-smoking hotel). These trash piles have been building for the 2 days we have been here (none of it is ours and none of it has been cleared in 48 hours).
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"When on the strip for a weeklong conference or tournament, Vdara is now my #1 choice of stay.  Lovely to come back to the calmness of this non-smoking and no casino resort after a long day.Spacious and quiet was my suite. At home I was with the comfortable bed, spa-like tub, automatic shades, and, kitchenette. Spectacular was the view of the Bellagio fountains and the mountains.If not using Vdara's Club Lounge, it's nice to have the Market Cafe and Starbucks at the premise for takeouts in the mornings; and, delightful to have a nightcap at Vice Versa especially on weeknights.Along with the impeccable service I received from their front desk to housekeeping staff, a stress relief and wonderful Vegas oasis Vdara truly made.CHEERS!"
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"By far my favorite resort on the strip. I would even go far by saying this is my headquarters when I want to get away for a little bit. Me and my family have stayed at the Vdara since it's opening back in 2008. I've had many enjoyable occasions here such as my 18th birthday to my going away before I left the states for a bit. The Vdara Resort and Spa is located in the Las Vegas city center. By the way, city center is the place for high luxury on the strip in my opinion. The Aria and Cosmopolitan are beside her.Upon arrival, the Vdara has valet only parking. One of my favorite highlights is that the team is so welcoming ever time I arrive or depart. I'm always addressed by my last name where ever I go. This is a plus! I never get this anyway. I've stayed in countless Vdara suites but my favorite one is the Loft sky suites. I was able to stay at the luxurious 56th floor with a 2 bedroom room. I cannot tell you how fun it is. How I put it, "" we're on top of my city in the best resort in town! ""I cannot wait to return! Thank you MGM properties!"
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"Check in is at 3pm.  Out suite was not ready and thus far waiting in the lobby for a hour.  This blows, why aren't the rooms ready? Are you over boome."
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"Check in is at 3pm.  Out suite was not ready and thus far waiting in the lobby for a hour.  This blows, why aren't the rooms ready? Are you over booked? With all the competition in Vegas, taking over an hour to get your reserved room, after 3pm is unacceptable."
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"Was in town for my friend's birthday. He's stayed here a few times before and it was his birthday so this is the hotel he chose. This was my first time staying here and to be honest I'll probably make this my go-to hotel while in Las Vegas. To begin with, if you use their sister app for booking you get free valet your entire stay! Another thing I really enjoyed was not having to walk through a casino full of cigarette smoke in-order-to check-in and to get to my room throughout my stay. I have bad asthma to the point I had a nebulizer with me during this visit- so, this was super important to me to stay away from smoke. If you really need to go to a casino the Aria is walking distance from the Vdara, literally right next door. Initially, there was only suppose to be two of us but, last second another two friends decided to make the drive to Las Vegas. We just got the regular room because it fit two perfectly- luckily for our last minute friends the room has a couch that pulls out into a bed! Perfect! Those two slept on the pull out and we took the bed. The room was nice and we didn't need an extremely large space because most of our time was spent outside the room. I like that the room came with a kitchenette! Fully stocked fridge (we came with our own items tho) empty fridge next to it, stove top, cabinets, sink and a cute little table with two chairs. The bathroom had a deep tub and a shower. Also, has a large area in front of the mirror for makeup lol. All employees we encountered were very friendly and professional. I think there's a Starbucks in the lobby and a lobby bar if you want to have a little drink when you first arrive. This hotel is a little hidden off the strip but, close enough that Uber wasn't more than $10 a trip (from piranha nightclub) and a regular taxi was only $5 from the restaurant we went to the first night (nacho daddy). Overall, I did really enjoy this hotel for multiple reasons and will be reserving a room here next time I come into town. Ohh and I almost forgot! This hotel is dog friendly!!! Next time just might have to bring ChloeAnn too and check out their 24 hour dog park!"
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"17-Feb-2019My wife and decided to take a trip for Valentine's Day to love on one another and to take a break from our busy lives as executives, entrepreneurs and parents.My colleague stays at the Vdara Hotel & Spa every year for Christmas and when I told her of my potential plans to go for Valentine's Day weekend she said I had to stay here. She was so kind to pass along an amazing deal that we couldn't pass up. It was a once a year special that included a 25% discount for each night booked and buffet (once a day) at the ARIA for two people for the duration of our stay. We were impressed from our first call to inquire about the deal. We spoke to Norma in booking and she explained every detail to us. She even went on to find us discount tickets to the Cirque de Soleil Michael Jackson experience. She even went a step further and got reservations for us to have dinner at Lupo (an Italian restaurant in Mandalay Bay) before our show.We can go on forever about why this is probably the best hotel Las Vegas, but we will mention a few reasons it stands out the most:1. The special we took advantage of was one-of-a-kind.2. Check-in was fast and easy.3. You can pay a fee (about $50) to check in at 11am if rooms are available on your day of check-in.4. This is a non-smoking hotel, so you won't smell like smoke and won't have sketchy people standing around smoking downstairs.5. This is a dog-friendly hotel.6. Our studio had a kitchen area with stove-top to cook. Some rooms have a washer and dryer.7. Robots, yes ROBOTS deliver your non-warm food items!8. This hotel does not have a casino!9. It smells fresh and clean in the lobby and you notice it as a soon as you walk into the building.This was our first time in Las Vegas together and thanks to the Vdara Hotel & Spa it certainly will not be our last. We will come again and will only stay at the Vdara Hotel & Spa! We will tell everyone about our experience because it was so memorable and pleasant.Thanks,Ashley and Lindsey Head"
Vdara Hotel & Spa,Yelp,"Just checked out of VdaraLV and want so say how sad I was to do so. It was a great experience from check-in to check-out. Fantastic, clean suites and I had a nice view. Many thanks to Elias for ensuring my first stay here was a memorable one. The young woman at concierge was super friendly and helpful as well. Finally, the hostess at market cafe smiled and provided exceptional customer service to every guest that entered while I was waiting for my Togo order. I can't wait to come back."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Trump has been on a short list of resorts to stay at, two reasons.Quality of the product and how quiet I have been told it is.First off, The desk staff is very professional, very polite. Check in was very efficient and they gave me the room I requested.  The Valet staff is fast... I mean fast. I would request my car and by the time I walked to the front it was parked up front. About 10 min total I would say....So that is awesome of them. Don't forget to tip these guys, the hustle. Don't be cheap... Second, the Pool. We went down to the pool every night at 6:30 there was literally nobody there, it was quiet and very nice to just relax in. Considering no hot tub due to Covid the warm pool was just perfect as it was 100 degrees this weekend. The room was very clean, an abundance of towels and they even brought additional shampoo, body wash and such the next morning without being requested.The coffee selection was stocked daily during the housekeeping service. I wasn't lacking anything and did not need to request anything.What is wonderful about Trump compared to any of the resorts, is how quiet it is. NO loud kids, or drunks. No idiots on scooters, everyone was polite and respectful. The security at the elevators was very professional and I like the fact they make guest use their card to access the rooms. I value privacy and security, and compared to any other resorts with exception to maybe Wynn and Aria Trumps Security is top notch.The location of Trump is perfect of people who don't want to walk the strip, and actually have business to attend to through Las Vegas, its maybe 2 lights and you are the the 15, its very close to China Town and if you take Industrial it goes straight to downtown with literally ZERO traffic. After staying at Wynn, Aria, Vdara, Cosmo and the usual lower tier resorts Trump is probably going to be my go to. If you want relaxing, quiet and secure... Trump is the spot.Pro Tip. If you have guest who meed you or visit you at the Trump as I did the mall parking across the street is free and secure. And its  literally a 5 minute walk."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"I just want to be clear that I may be a small % of the world but I am still that % of people who absolutely loathes las Vegas. I am sorry but it's true. I don't gamble, I hate touristy places, way too many ratchet people, it's just feels like a sad & uncool place for me. With that said, I recently moved to San Diego and between work and friends Vegas does get thrown into the mix every blue moon. My bf and I compromised on going to Vegas for his best friends 40th if we could stay at a nice hotel away from the awfulness. We picked the trump hotel. Although my time was short but sweet, we didn't use even 50% of the amenities but I loved this hotel and would stay there anytime I ever have to go to Vegas. For everyone who is crying that there's not a casino in this hotel is ridiculous. Firstly - it's no surprise. It only takes a moment to check. In fact on most hotel websites it weeds this hotel out on a basic search when you type in hotels without casinos. Also, not for nothing. You can casino hop at every place in Vegas only a walk or cab ride away. The best part of non casino hotels - the lack of smoke and lack of casino people roaming the hotel. We didn't eat at the restaurant downstairs but it looked nice and clean and honestly civil. Football was playing on Sunday and it looked enjoyable and not rowdy. With Covid there isn't room service. I also saw people complaining on here about that. We're in the middle of a global pandemic. Why would a company put their own employees or guests at risk. They enforced masks, and had hand sanitizer everywhere which was nice.The pool looked beautiful but we didn't make it down. The only tiny complaint I had was that we were on the 18th floor facing pool and we could hear the music early in the morning in our room when we were trying to catch up on sleep.Other than that I would recommend staying here."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Classic treatment, safe even when Daddy Trump roles into town. We love this castle of class. Pool is chill and Olympic size for laps. Good rates during covid. The spa is top notch and incredible.Vegas is alive baby!"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Great value, epic service and a location second to none, the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas epitomizes a business stay while also clearly providing for a quiet, relaxing environment for non-business travel as well.The lack of a casino does well as an unconventional approach in the midst of the so-called ""City of Sin"" pricing a well-appreciated respite from the bells and whistles while being in close enough proximity to allow one to venture forth periodically to sample the fun while being able to retire in peace and tranquility after such forays.Highly recommended."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Stayed here second time, this time we came here last minute after a horrible experience in Strat. We got a suite and as expected, no problems! They really do an incredible job! They even serve Kona coffee . All the coffee lovers, you know the cost and taste of that coffee. Visited their restaurant again and absolutely no regrets! Thank you DJT!"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"This hotel has set a high bar for us! We were looking for a hotel in Vegas that did not have casinos but was close to the strip. This was a great choice, absolutely no regrets. In fact I would choose it again. You get more than what you pay for. The hotel is beautiful inside and out. Staff very friendly and helpful. Restaurant serves delicious dinner and breakfast. We stayed on 50th floor, view was breathtaking. Jetted bathtub, with another shower separate. Very clean. Has a shuttle that takes you to the strip. Even gardens has sounds of birds singing, creating peaceful atmosphere in the middle of a city. This was the best stay in a hotel I had so far. Thank you DJT!"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Our stay here was amazing. It is indeed a 5-star hotel. Service was great, each part of the hotel was super clean, and the room is AWESOME! Got a jacuzzi in the bathroom. The view from our room was the strip and the hotel is just in front of the mall. Love it!"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Disgusting rooms, horrible service and even worse management. Shocking its still standing afloat. Vegas deserves better."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"My wife and I chose to stay here during our honeymoon recently. From the moment we stepped out of our car at the valet on the first night to the moment we picked up our car from valet on the last day, we were treated with excellent hospitality and service. The room was spacious, clean, and had all the amenities you could expect from a fine hotel like the Trump. Huge bathtub, beautiful tiled shower, his and hers sink, tons of towels and toiletries. Very extensive kitchenette in suite that even had electric burners for cooking! We had a problem with the coffee maker, one call to the front desk and ten minutes later had a brand new one in hand! Housekeeping was fantastic daily and we made sure to tip them generously for their outstanding work. Satellite TV with a wide plethora of channels, we enjoyed using the DVR to record movies to watch in the evening while we went out during the day. I really liked the fact that instead of making you scan your room key card in the elevator every time, there is a kiosk with a staff member in front of the elevator area, and you only have to scan your card there once to get into the elevator area. This beats having to scan your card every time on the elevator, especially when the readers can be finicky at times! Had breakfast once at the restaurant downstairs and food was excellent. All employees greeted us with a smile and warm greeting. Valet parking is super easy as you just send them a text when you need your car and by the time you get downstairs, your car is there waiting for you! Made sure to tip them as well for their excellent service. This was a fantastic experience overall, and we were so glad we chose this hotel to stay in. Will definitely return and would recommend to anyone who needs a hotel in Vegas!"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Trump internationalTrying a new hotel. Every time I go to Vegas I always try to stay at a different hotel, this time I picked this to see what it was like.Honestly, I have to say that this was a great experience. First off, we've never stayed at a Trump property, I guess they wanted us  us to have the full Trump experience.  I loved how they pampered us. They upgraded us to the 51st floor, a suite, that had a two person Jacuzzi that overlooked the strip.  The room was spacious with a huge master bedroom, the living room had a panoramic view, a kitchenette, but there was nothing stocked in there for security reasons. You have to call Housekeeping to get plates, wine glasses, silverware whatever you might need.We had our own bath robes, slippers, the toiletries were great.  We really enjoyed the shower.I did go to the lounge to have a nightcap and we thought that the drinks were very expensive so we only had one, LOL.Everyone that worked there, from the Bellman to the people that checked us in, service staff, housekeepers, and the concierge were very friendly.It was close to the strip, easy walking distance, and they do offer a shuttle. It's a easy ride to and from the airport.  It was great to stay in a non-smoking non-gamingI WOULD RECOMMEND, I WOULD go back!"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"With the election going on I'm reminded of my experience at the Trump hotel in Vegas back in 2015, so I figured a review is far past due. In fact I probably should have posted when I used to be Yelp elite that this would get a bit more visibility.I stayed at the Trump hotel during a friend's bachelor party in Vegas there were 12 of us and we ended up renting one of the penthouse suites, The sweet itself was actually not too bad however there were many aspects of the hotel that bring me to a one-star rating.The number one thing that really bothered me about this hotel was the lack of a casino!! Why is there a hotel in Vegas with no casino, how does that make any sense? I thought the point of having a hotel in Vegas was that you could run a casino, but perhaps this just really isn't one of Trump's strong points, so he wanted to avoid it altogether haha! In any case this was something that very surprising to me and was a big part of the reason I disliked the hotel.Another point of annoyance was that the housekeeping staff was unwilling to make multiple trips into our room for servicing even though we were a very large party renting one of their nicer rooms. Actually, i doing the housing staff themselves cares, but the front desk just wasn't having it with us.... With the price that we were paying it just didn't make sense to me that they were unwilling to accommodate this small extra request. And this actually brings me on to the price, I was looking through my email to see if I could find how much I paid for our 2 night stay, but I couldn't exactly find it I just remember being extremely shocked by how much I had to pay even just sharing 1/11th of the price. For the location and lack of casino, just don't... Don't even bother.Overall I just wasn't impressed, this hotel was a huge bummer just like Trump himself."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"I was honestly surprised about the quality and service of this hotel. Taking politics aside from it all. I didn't give it a 5 because there were only 2 elevators working for our section of the hotel. I believe it was 39-52 floors. Which met long waits and a packed elevator. Sometimes had to wait for it to come back down cause it was so full. Also, no self park. This doesn't bother me but the person I was staying with is anal about other people driving their car and was annoyed they had to valet. So if that Applies to you keep it in mind. Overall the rooms are spacious even for a standard room. We had a small living space with a couch and each room has a mini kitchen in it. The best part is the bathroom which reading the over reviews it's a win for most people. The bathroom was huge and loved how you were crammed in their especially if you and your guest are both getting ready. Since I live in Vegas it was nice not to have to walk through a casino to get in and out of the hotel. On Top of it all the staff was overall pleasant and helpful. You can tell they put effort into their training and maybe it's because they are trying to make up for their owners rep? Either way I enjoyed my stay here."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Politics aside, would give it a 3.5Literally was dreading the stay and while I experienced the expected, the stay was comfortable and had its pros and cons. Just happened that this was the only property that we could stay during our booked dates with parents hilton club rewards. Otherwise, you would not find me in Trump property period. Trump International is next to the fashion mall and is only a short distance to Nordstrom that you can cut through to get to the strip.  It's a bit outside of the strip, but they offer shuttles to Wynn and Caesar about every 20 minutes. Wynn is actually only 8 minute walk that you can easily stroll during the day. Shuttles run 8AM to 12PM on M-T and Sun and 8AM to 2AM on Fri/Sat.What I didn't like about the shuttle was that there was no ropes to maintain the line.  Some rude Europeans were literally running for the shuttles while clearly there's a long line of people waiting for it in front of them... I made sure that they didn't cut in front of me. And while I thought it would be small, the size of the shuttles were sufficient as it's a pretty small hotel/property compared to other properties considering that it doesn't have a casino. Fits about 11 people and the driver. Valet is complimentary and was pretty fast on getting the cars, but avoid prime times like 4PM(check in time), 7PM (dinner time), and probably the check out time. Again, no ropes to maintain the line and had to tell the staff to attend to everyone in line first as a rude fob, who clearly spoke English, cut the whole line.Upon entering, there was 2 lines for check in, which was confusing. One seemed to be just the general line and the other was for reserved or something alike, which I can't recall the exact term it used but technically we had reservation. Possibly for those who checked in early and actually just need the keys?  They should make it more clear. The lobby has a bar, cafe, bathrooms, and a trump merchandise store.  I stepped inside just to check the COO of the merchandise.  Surprisingly USA for the hat that I checked and thank goodness there was no maga hats... but my stomach churned when I saw people taking pics in front of the store with huge smiles like it was Disney Land.To get to the elevators, you have to flash your keys to the staff every time, which I think was a good security measures, but wonder when they started the implementation or for what concerns. hmmm...Be warned, elevators are super fast that your ears pop.  Rooms were pretty spacious, but the furnishing is outdated.  We got lucky but our parents suite had a weird stench to it. Not sure if it was just the Vegas air or the hotel's, but at night it's pretty dry and smoky. Otherwise the rooms were okay and it does provide bottled waters.For hilton club reservations, you cannot bring a pet, but the hotel is pet friendly and there's a pet relief area outside. Also for hilton club reservations, daily room clean is not available unless you stay longer than 5 days, but you can request for extra towels and such.Can't help to wonder about the people who stay here, especially seeing and experiencing the things that happened here, but got through our stay. Americans tend not to interact with the Asians as we were dismissed by a family as they directly asked another american family about the line while we were directly in front of them, and surprisingly there were a lot of fobs and Europeans that stayed here.Overall, okay stay, but still a bit inconvenient as it's not on the strip and my poor experience was more from the others that stayed here than the staff."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"I was excited to receive a really good price through my job. Politics aside, I had heard really good things about this hotel. After traveling all day, we were able to check in early, which was pretty awesome. Our room was very spacious and organized at first glance. We laid down to nap since we'd been up for almost 24 hours and realized the pillows were extremely flat. You might as well just laid on the hard mattress. After tossing and turning, we decided to explore the hotel. We went to the pool only to find out it was under ""scheduled routine maintenance"". My husband called the front desk to ask about the other accommodations for the pool, and they told him that they would shuttle us to the Hilton to use their pool. I'd like to add that the Hilton is at the other end of the strip, and once you get there, you'd have to call Trump hotel when you're ready to come back and wait for the shuttle to pick you up. I was mostly upset that no one mentioned this at the time of booking or check in. I'm pregnant and from the east coast, so I was really looking forward to swimming. We checked out the menu in our room and everything was extremely over priced. On top of that, it was a $4 delivery fee and a 18% gratuity automatically added. I didn't have much of a choice when I woke up starving at 5 in the morning, so we ordered the continental breakfast. Warning, it's just a bowl of yogurt, an apple, and two croissants for $25 before the other charges are added. The shower water takes about 5 minutes to heat up, and then the water doesn't drain. By the end of my shower, the water was almost up to the edge, so I turned it off in fear I'd flood the bathroom. I got into the jacuzzi tub with my husband to find black lint circling the top and hair clogged into the drain. The sheets had hair on them from previous guests & the comforter had brown stains on them. I thought the tables were marble, but they were just that dusty (pictured). Everything in the room is. I don't recommend putting a drink next to you because any movement causes the dust to fly up everywhere. Our room went without cleaning the first day, because we had our ""do not disturb"" sign up at 9 am, but took it away when we left at about 10 am. We came back around 1 and our room wasn't cleaned. The next day, our room was ""made up"", but the glass cups were not replaced after use, and no dusting took place.Overall disappointed in the quality of the hotel considering the brand and the price. I feel like it's just a money hole, because literally nothing is included except water in the room. Wouldn't stay here again."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Worst experience in Las Vegas, and I've stayed all over there. Save yourself an Uber/ Car ride and stay on the strip."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Incredible experience here. The highest quality luxury in Vegas. My room was MASSIVE! It had two full bathrooms and one bedroom! 58th floor. I got a great deal on my room, and the upgrade fee was nothing for the amount of luxury I got to experience. Massive jetted tub with a view of the strip. Everything worked perfectly, everyone was nice. There's no casino here, which is great. The restaurant and bar was great, large portions. I got a lot of fun things from the gift shop. I will stay NO WHERE ELSE in Vegas. What's the point? You get everything here! The President was also here when I stayed here, so I got to have the whole secret service experience, which was also very cool. One thing I did notice, again, the hotel was totally soundproof. However, in the morning, when the Presidents motorcade left, you could hear people screaming on the ground! It was truly beautiful. 58 floors up!! I didn't hear anything else anywhere the entire time!"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"Just wow! Like the others, I'm not here to take a political stance. I applaud the Trump business.I found a good rate for this hotel online, and when I got here, I was really taken care of by Denise at the front counter. She gave me a supppppppper nice room. Arguably, the nicest room I've ever stayed at. A king studio suite on the 49th floor with lovely views. Just see the pictures!There's no casino here, and to me, that's a flip side because I abhor the smell of cigarettes and alcohol that plague casinos. However, there are also frequent shuttles that go from this hotel to Caesar's palace and the Wynn.I would definitely opt to stay at the Trump and I would love to be taken care of by Denise again. You rock, girl!--Edit: This hotel almost got away with a solid five stars from me until my last day departure. I specifically asked housekeeping in the morning around 10am to service my room and they said there were going to have it done. Come 2pm, not only is the the room not serviced at all, but I had to call them again and they gave me some bs about the room not being able to be serviced on same departure....? Hey, if they told me that earlier instead of ""someone will be right up and have that done for you,"" I would have been fine.However, inconsistency and no delivery on service are bad business practices. In the words of Donald Trump, whoever was in working housekeeping and managing that process, you should be ""fired."" Don't say you're going to do things that you don't end up doing and or don't be consistent! It's not that hard to service a room either way. I'm a highly considerate and clean guest who picks up after myself. I would have appreciated some light servicing at the very least.There's plenty of other hotels on the strip and I'd be hesitant to come back again."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,Worst hotel I've ever been to. This is the true Circus Circus. The rooms were disgusting and there is more to do by staring at a wall than in this hotel. The food was either over cooked or extremely raw. It was such a horrible experience that we left and went to Mandalay Bay for the remainder of our trip
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"5 months prior to our stay I was looking for a hotel that had a good location, was non-smoking if possible, free valet or parking, great fitness center, complimentary breakfast and a great price as the prices for hotels were high for September but on Ebates I found a great deal for this hotel and indeed when we arrived, we were quite surprised.  I know friends who would not stay at this hotel due to political reasons but we try to be objective and look for a comfortable, convenient hotel that has amenities we enjoy and this hotel met most of our needs:  price, comfortable, convenience, service.  We were greeted courteously and had a sizable hotel room and noticed that it was clean, spacious and comfortable with k-cup coffee maker, Wolf cooktop, Subzero mini fridge, wet bar, garbage disposal, toaster, microwave, complimentary bottled water, safe, double vanity sinks, large shower and separate jacuzzi tub and toilet, great view of the pool and surrounding hotels, free valet and parking (tip not included), free shuttle to Caesar's Palace and the Wynn (shuttle bus seats 14 and can get busy at peak times), double door entryway to hotel room so less noisy, quiet hallways, adequate fitness center so what more can you ask for?  During our 3 day stay, my husband lost his valet card so it was no problem as they just issued him another and were able to locate our rental car.  The shuttle bus was too crowded when we wanted to go to Caesar's Palace for a show; however on the way back after 12:30 am, we were able to catch it to the hotel without any problems.  I enjoyed the fitness center and it had most of the props I use when I work-out, like free weights, stability ball, kettle bells, mat, medicine all, wipes, water, towels.  My husband used the pool and it was good but it did get a bit windy the day he swam in it so he didn't complete his work-out due to the wind.  The only con was that I could hear the trains in the middle of the night but I went back to sleep.  I could not hear any noise coming from the hallway or any of the hotel guests.  The hotel is elegant and I would stay here again."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,Yelp,"I was passing through Vegas and thought I'd get some rest before continuing my save my sanity drive- I checked some hotel sites for hotel no casino and This came up. Surprised, I called and asked if I could check in early- (8:30am)- surprised again they said sure and I drove there, fortunately no politics no protests, fast easy check in - everyone masked/ antibacterial sanitizer everywhere, room was immaculate and all plates dishes glasses removed but sign stating sanitized items available by calling- I got wine glasses- new corkscrew which was given to me. Normal folks about no politics yay / so tired of that / rested and 5 minute walk to strip at night lots of places open fairly good separation and everyone masked save few homeless yet I gave them 30 feet and stayed masked, the brand is well everyone had their opinions mine is it was an apolitical full 24 hour stay / great rate good service."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,Shout out to Mikey at the check in desk. A1 customer service. Worked on a higher floor for us.  Very accommodating! He has to be the super star there. The hotel is very conscientious about COVID and has sanitizer everywhere and masks by the elevator! If I could only win some of my money back!!It's best to check out at the front desk and not just drop your key in the drop box so that you are not charged for any of the room extras. Apparently I bumped the coffee pot/machine and was charged 10$ because it suggested I used it. It takes longer to fix the error than its worth. I just wonder how many people bump the machine and get charged. They must make a killing off of that!
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Stay: 10/11-10/13My wife and I wanted to get away with the baby so we decided on Mandalay Bay due to a few reasons, including 1) pool complex 2) suite price 3) availability of cribOur car was packed with baby stuff so before checking in, we pulled up to the front entrance and used the bellhop service.  They give you a ticket and hold your bags for you, and once you check in and arrive to your room, you call them and they bring it up.  Bellhop service also available when checking out.Overall, we had a great stay and enjoyed our mini vacation.Pros:Clean, spacious suite.  We stayed in the Penthouse Skyview Suite on the 60th floor.  2 flat screen TV's - one in living room, the other in the bedroom.Small sink located behind counter which came in handy as we washed the baby's bottles there.  Small mini fridge provided, in addition to their stocked fridge.They provided 2 masks and hand sanitizer.  The masks were great quality and re-usable.  Only gripe would be the pillows on the bed were large and uncomfortable.  Mattress itself was soft and great though.Friendly service - the bellhop, housekeeping staff, front desk staff, security were all kind and ready to help.Pool - their complex is massive and was the highlight of our trip.  We reserved 2 chairs with an umbrella and were placed right in front of the wave pool.The wave pool has a 48"" minimum height requirement, but they have a shallow area off to the side where babies can play.They also have a fun lazy river where you can bring your own tubes or you can rent one for $.Staff walks around and provides disposable masks for anyone walking around or sitting down and not eating/drinking.  Masks are not required when in the water.The hotel providing a crib (Pack n play) was one of the main reasons why we stayed here.  When contacting other properties, such as Caesars, they would not provide one due to covid restrictions.Cons:Check in was a hassle, as there was a long line and people were not practicing social distancing.  They have a mobile check-in app and I recommend you utilize that to save time.We checked in at the counter because we wanted to make sure we received the baby crib (pack n' play) for our little one.No social distancing in elevatorsThey do not enforce capacity limits in any of their elevators.  In the parking garage there are only 2 elevators, so be prepared to either wait or cram into them, especially if you come on a weekend when it's busier.Food options limited.  This is due to covid so not the property's fault, but the options were mediocre at best.We got breakfast at Citizen's and the food was not that good or worth the money paid.We got dinner at Burger Bar and the quality of the burgers was underwhelming.  We did have a good experience with breakfast at House of Blues.  I recommend going there for a meal.If you have time, go to a restaurant off the strip - plenty of great options for anything you're in the mood for.Housekeeping services were lagging, most likely due to covid.  After we checked in and arrived to our room, we called housekeeping to request for the crib and extra towels and it took 1.5 hours to arrive."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Was there for few days on a vacation they are very strict on covid 19 at the hotel u have to put a mask everywhere including the pool area , they have masks and hand sanitizer all over the hotel if u need to use.This was good for safety,it was pretty packed for this timeThe rooms are very nice but room cleaning not so great Hotel pool was really nice , I'd say for a laid back vacation it's nice but I would take some Clorox for the room so u have for the covid clean since the rooms aren't super clean.Room window view was super nice , I'd give this place 4 stars"
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,They are like the Frontier Airline. Charge for everything.  The first hotel I ever stayed that charges for the coffee maker in the room. Tv did not work the first night.  Extremely hot water that you can cool unless you run the water 15 minutes in the shower.  Mask staff seem to have a nasty attitude. I get it no one wants to hassle people to keep there mask on.  They seem to be trained differently day by day. They close the only pool that offers shade without a fee.  Charging 100.00 for an umbrella and three chairs is ridiculous when you close the only pool that has shade.
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"My friend had been to Vegas many times and enjoyed staying the Four Seasons, which is on the top 4 floor of the Mandalay Bay; so I decided to stay at the Mandalay Bay so that way we could all just meet in the lobby if we wanted to go anywhere.  It was easy to book the room on the Mandalay Bay website, but the prices kept changing so I constantly had to check back and forth to get the best rate; luckily all the rates booked were able to be cancelled and refunded as all rooms required a deposit (which they did charge to the credit card at the time of the booking). The hotel is located at the end of the strip and there is a grand entrance - there are two entrances, one to the casino and one to the resort.  Also, there are two hotels connected to the resort - the Mandalay Bay and the Delano (as well as the Four Seasons); its one big maze, not a lot of signage and lots of confusion.  The check-in desks were located at the end of the lobby and there was long roped off area in which to line-up for the check-in desks - like a check-in line at the airport.  The type of service received at check-in depended on which representative you received - some were good at providing details while others only provided the basic information; at check-in I only received the basic information but at check-out I received all the information, some of which would've been helpful at the beginning.  I checked, received the key, and proceeded to my room.  Regarding Covid-19 protocols, there were markers placed on the floor to remind guests to social distance while in line, but this was not enforced and it was left up to each individual to their discretion.  There were also masks and sanitizers stations placed each door entryway.There were different elevator bays depending on which floor your room was located, and each bay had about 8 different elevators so in theory it would be easy to social distance given there is a lot of option; however, again it was left upto the individual to make this decision as the hotel did not provide any guidance or signage regarding this fact.  My room was on the 11th floor and as you get in, the room was bigger than I expected.  As you walk inside the door, you walk down a mini-hallway to get to the room.  The room has two beds against the right-side of the wall and along the left was a desk connected to a chest with drawers on the bottom, coffee-maker and paid bottle water on top, and then a mini-bar below (which was weight sensitive so even if you picked it up and put it back down, it automatically charged to the room).  Against the opposite wall were the two beds which were large, comfortable and provided a good night's sleep; again the bed and sleep quality was better than I expected.  In the middle was a nightstand with a lamp and outlets and there were outlets on either side of the beds (which was convenient.  One wall was covered with windows which allowed for lots of light to come inside - and our view was of the airport, which was great for an aviation lover as you could see (but not hear) planes take off all day.  The entrance to bathroom was located next to the beds, and there were individual closets on either side of the bathroom entrance.  The bathroom was huge, and again, bigger and better than I expected.  There were double sinks with lots of counter space, a full jacuzzi tub, a shower, and a covered toilet.  There were also plenty of toiletries including soap, lotion, shampoo, conditioner and towels and if you requested more tons were provided.  Overall, it was a spacious and comfortable hotel room with plenty of room to move and rest.As it was a resort, there were plenty of amenities for guests to enjoy including many pools, business center, shows, an aquarium, restaurants, casinos, spas and a man-made beach inside the resort.  Because of the 'resort' status, the hotel included a daily resort fee which covered internet, local calls and other non-essential items; to me, and reviewing what was part of the fee, it was a fee that was designed to gain more money from the guests as it covered nothing and guests were still being charged for other items.  The resort did include complimentary wifi, but the wifi was open to everyone so there was no need for a login so, again, not sure what the fee was good for?  Because of the pandemic, certain cabanas and chairs were not utilized and staff went around asking guests who were not in the pool to keep their masks on - so that was a pleasant point.Overall, it was a mixed experience at Mandalay Bay.  The rooms were nice, spacious and comfortable so that was on the plus side; there were also many amenities for the guests to enjoy so that was also positive; negative was that customer service was not great, the resort fee seemed inconsequential, and there was a lack of signage and direction (it was not well laid out)."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,Had an excellent time at the Mandalay Bay Casino.  Hand sanitizer stations were everywhere and employees were constantly wiping down the machines and chairs.  Felt very save during the visit.Played lots of new machines and found a few favorites.  Had a few good hits and left with cash in pocket.  A good day at the casino...
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Just returned from a 2 night stay.  I will admit, I've never stayed here before simply because of the location, and the fact I like to walk on the strip from casino to casino, but since so much of Vegas is still closed, and  there are no shows, this seemed like the perfect opportunity to try it out.  I'm happy to report, I only had a couple issues which were quickly resolved, other than that, I had a great time.   The stay didn't reach the level of ""As good as it gets"", but yes, I'm definitely a fan.  I've also stayed at the Bellagio and the Aria since COVID-19 so I have something to compare it too. Unfortunately, there is still no valet thanks to Covid-19, which means hauling your luggage from the parking garage in the back of the casino to the front where the lobby and hotel elevators are.  Sadly, only about 50% of the guests are smart enough to not get in an already packed elevator so don't be putz in and get in a hurry.  Wait for empty elevator or one with only 2-3 people in it.  Nothing is running on time right now. I did the mobile check-in (from another casino along my driving from California route. shhhh, don't tell) and showed up after my room key was available.  Unfortunately, there is something about my phone that doesn't allow it work in the elevator to activate the floor.  I walked myself and my luggage to the lobby and saw a long line.   This didn't amuse me.  I walked around looking for the tablets to create a key which Bellagio and Aria had, but was struggling to find it.   An employee actually approached me asking if I needed help.   He immediately pointed me to the area to make a room key and explained my phone is too old to work on the elevator, but the it did work to open my door.   He saved the day!   I had my room keys and was on my way.  I stopped at the mlife desk to activate my free play and food and beverage credit.  I asked where the food court was and she had the oddest look on her face, almost an ""you're not going to like the answer"" look.  She explained it was way on other side of the building.   Well, she's right.  I felt like I was walking back to California, but on a positive note, you get some steps in.   By the time I got there around 6:05pm, I was too late.  Everything closed at 6pm, except for Subway, and I could see why.   If there hotel isn't full, who's going to walk this far for food?  (It's by the Shark Reef entrance if you're curious).  I'm sure they were busy during pre-covid-19 days, but it was disappointing to walk that for Subway.  I can't really blame the layout of the building though.  It wasn't designed to take into account a national pandemic. My room was great.  It was an Executive Room which an added living area looking out the window and a small table/desk.  I was disappointed there wasn't a bathrobe like Bellagio or Aria, but it's not a deal breaker.  The face mask they provided is super comfortable.  That was actually better than the Bellagio or Aria. However, it's thicker so I had problems breathing so I couldn't use it very long.  I did like the brand of hand sanitizer.  It was more of a gel which was nice.After returning to my room around midnight, the TV was stuck on TBS with some ""Data error"" message.  Slightly annoying, but livable since I was going to sleep anyway.I ordered room service 3 times and it was great!  (See my review about Citizens.)   I called the next morning about the TV and they were able to reboot it remotely which was nice.  Upon checking out remotely, I found some food charges were credited to my comps so I called Guest Services from the room phone and they were able to get everything covered and also check me out over the phone.  Great service!  Except for the fact I didn't win a lot of money this trip, I enjoyed the stay.  I had a view of the airport and enjoyed watching the planes take off and land.  I wish they would have had more tables open as they filled up quickly at night, but I understand the need to balance hotel occupancy with labor for gaming.  I was able to walk over to the Luxor though for my table game fix.  I think took less time to walk over there than to Subway.Thanks for a great stay!"
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"I've never stayed here overnight, too far away from anything, but I do always stop here during my trips to Vegas.I love the Casino.  A very nice assortment of machines and for some reason, I always do well here.  The Michael Jackson One show is amazing for those of us that grew up in the 80's.  I really like their buffet as well.  I'm into comfort food not fancy recipes like the Wicked Spoon or Bellagio buffets.  The one here just suits my tastes.  The Mlife counter always seems to be a little busy.  I wish they had machines to check points, etc, but that's in Mlife issue not Mandalay Bay's.  Self-parking it a little tricky if you've never been here before, and actually even if you've been here a few times.  There was a lot of construction cones around making it difficult to know where I could turn and not.  When I get there, I like to enter self-parking from the back of the resort. Make sure to check out the aquarium if you visit.  A nice get away from gambling."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"How can you really share anything positive when the staff is so rude? You give em one star check out and don't return to the property.There's no friendliness at all! And talk about times that we're going thru! The rooms are nice and clean the cleaning staff is friendly and does a great job! I'm talking about the front desk rude crew!Anyhow I will not stay at this place again, Vegas is FULL of great hotels out there. Peace out Mandalay"
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"I've stayed at Mandalay many times over the years but thought I'd write a review about the property in terms of COVID.In terms of the hotel itself, it's one of the nicer places to stay on the strip.  The rooms are great, very comfortable and spacious.  The bathrooms are large with a separate shower and large tub (although they did remove the small Flat screen TVs that used to be in there). The Pool is thee best on the strip and is worth the cost of the stay.In terms of times during COVID, they only really checked your temperature when you're line to check-in, but I'm not sure why businesses are still utilizing this when it's scientifically proven that a fever is not really an accurate symptom of COVID.  Check-In though for me was a breeze on a Friday afternoon, didn't have any problem but they do have self-check-in now on the app so I'll probably utilize that next time.  The pool was limited capacity and masks were required if not in the pool, eating or drinking.  The lazy river was also limited capacity and had a line to hop in.  In terms of amenities, about half of the restaurants and bars are closed on the property.  We ended up going over to the Shops next door in the mall to dine (Hussongs, Ra Ri), where all the restaurants were open there.  The bars at Mandalay, you had to be seated to order a drink so no walking up to a bar anymore to get one.  Some of the casino bars required hostess to be seated.  The whole thing was just a downer and not the typical Vegas experience you're used to.  I did walk over to Luxor and Excalibur and although they are also owned by MGM, they're requirements were less strict and I felt more Vegas ""normal"" there then I did at Mandalay.  Over there you could walk up and order a drink.Some other notes, they did go back to Free Self Parking which is a bonus.  The valets are closed. Alcohol is now expensive if you're not comp'd, a bottle of Bud Light at the Sportsbook was $9.75 :-(Overall, being from LA where everything is shut down and outdoors only, it was nice to feel somewhat normal being able to go inside, eat, drink and gamble but it's still not the wild Vegas feel to it anymore."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Yes, I traveled to Vegas during the pandemic. It's my half way point on the way to Bryce and Zion. Hotel room itself was a 4 star actually. Got the accessible room since it was the only one available for checking in early or i get 2 queens. So assessible it was. It works great if you got little one to be honest. So it worked out. The Pros:- AC was quiet, thank you. Bathroom was roomy. Room was clean and bed and pillows were comfortable for a good night snooze. Love the beach sandy pool with waves. My kiddo loovvvees it! Whenever the kiddo is happy, it makes mommys day always and a win. They gave all guest a little baggy with hand sanitizer and 2 face mask. Their Hotel floor has proxy glass dividers on the tables games and some close slots machines. Most were just turned off at every other machine. One additional positive was the installation of 4 hand wash stations on the slot machine floor area with lots of hand sanitizer stands everywhere. They had securities making rounds to remind visitors to be compliant with having mask on even at the pool. They would carry face mask around to enforce people to wear them if they don't have one. The Cons:Checking in was horrible. From parking to hotel lobby was super far. So if you have lots of luggages,  you will get an exercise for sure or request for bell personnel. Upon checking in, there was a Ambulance technician that checks your temperature before you check in. This is NOT consistent as that is the ONLY time they check your temp. Although I don't believe checking temp even does anything, if you decide to have someone do it, at least me consistent, not to mention when the lady in front of me asked what her temp was, the tech did NOT even know where to look on the contactless temp machine. Really?! How can you be assigned to do one important thing and have no clue what the temp was?! So whats the point?! And I'll be scared to have this ambulance person save me outside of what he was doing! Please MGM, if you are hiring these guys, please make sure they know what they are doing if you decide to practice this (again, even though i don't think this is an accurate or the best prevention). They have sensor sensitive items in fridge and on table top. Very dangerous if you have kids. I got fridge locked but table top, weren't able to which sucks as I always have to be on high alert. I seriously don't want to have to stress out like this while on vacay you know. Lastly, if not all rooms are occupied, why can't front desk put guest in every other room so I don't have to hear super loud people next room to us waking up my child? Sigh.....All and all, I will still stay here again. It's generally a very nice hotel especially for the ones who love to swim. Their hotel is interconnected to Luxor as well so it's nice to not have to walk outside to hop to another hotel for extra safety for some."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Booked 2 night stay. 4 stars for room with view of the strip, nice, clean and spacious. 1 star for the pool, although the water temperature is better than Caesars and Luxor. But damn, WTF y'all put into that pool. My wife and I, both of my kids have super dry skin after we spent about hour and half hour in the pool. My daughter and I both developed rash all over our body and the itch wouldn't stop. We decided not to use the pool the next day, super disappointed."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"They are killing us with the prices on the drinks!!! Mojito was $30!!! 2 mojitos, a bucket of beer $100!!! No way, it's highway robbery, I think I'm sticking to laughlin!!"
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,Amazing hotel great treatment awesome restaurants great hotel rooms I think it's awesome the best hotel I've ever stood at
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,It's been two days and they haven't refunded my deposit. About to file a dispute. Mandalay Bay takes two weeks to refund deposit and recommends filing a dispute with credit card company to get back stolen deposit money.
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Weekday cheaper the Friday Saturday. Even weekdays nickel and dime you. Every request is a charged upgrade. Strip views costs more . Higher floor cost. Coffee and water in room big charge. Your resort free includes pool but not a padded chair , umbrella or drinking fountain or lazy river float. Breakfast starts at 11am?! Deep end of pool closed. Takes five minutes for front desk to answer phone. Hot tub closed. Avoid this price gouging rip off at all costs. Ignore fake paid five star reviews."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"I understand enforcing rules to placate the ""COVID"" situation in order to stay open, as long as rules are enforced equally. However, there were multiple instances where higher paying customers did not have to abide. Specifically, at their pool and beach areas. Every patron that was in a paid for section of the pool area (ie., cabanas and ""special"" reserved poolside lounges) did not have to wear masks, but if you were sitting in the ""free"" lounges, you were forced to wear a mask despite high temperatures. It's alright, I'm notifying the health department that if you pay money you can't spread an allegedly deadly virus...TL, DR? If you pay more you don't have to follow ""COVID"" rules."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Bro I swear this place gets worse every time!Spent the night at a friends downtown, I come back to MB in the morning to get my stuff from my room before checkout time. I walk into the elevator First I noticed the smell. I sniff it's pretty potent. I look around....THERE IS A GIANT THING OF SMEARED SH*T ON THE FLOOR OF THE ELEVATORand yes did I step in it. This was around 6:30am-7amWhen I got to my room I tried to call it in to the front desk but guess what? MY ROOM PHONE IS NOT WORKING LIKE IT HAD BEEN MY WHOLE STAY9am. grab my stuff. Head down to the elevators. Wouldn't you know I caught the same elevators with the smeared crap on the floor. TWO HOURS LATER AND ITS STILL IN THERE. NO ONE HAD CLEANED IT UPNever coming back here again. Mandalay Bay is finished...."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"Every time I come back here, it just gets worse and worse.Disclaimer: everything I bring has existed PRE COVID, so the hotel's response to the pandemic has no bearing on their crappy hospitalityThe past decade has seen a considerable drop in the quality of table games on the strip, particularly in regards to blackjack. You're looking at $25 minimums for H17, and no surrender rules. Their high limit is a joke with $300 minimums for S17, plus CSMs that are more numerous than shoesBut that stuff doesn't really matter to the average visitor to these properties. What should matter is the quality of the dealers.I've been to MGM, Bellagio, Luxor, TI, Caesar's, the Plaza and the El Cortez, the nastiest dealers are at Mandalay Bay. You'd get more charm and professionalism from a bag of smashed ass. Every dealer I've had at MB whether it was BJ, poker or roulette have all been mean-spirited dicks. I get the job is difficult but literally every dealer has been awful to me. I've had dealers at Mandalay Bay short me, bark at me, telling me to get lost when I don't give them my ID quick enough Tipping doesn't seem to change their attitude either. They're dead inside. They don't care. The pit doesn't care. The players don't care either. It's an episode of the walking dead when you set foot into the casino....Their saving grace is the wave pool. The employees down there are much nicer and laid back. The food I've never had a problem with and neither the servers, but you'd get a better deal for about the same quality downtownThe strip's been going downhill for a while. This isn't about corona. Robert De Niro summed it up at the end of Casino and that film came out over 25 years agoProbably won't be back"
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,Yelp,"First off, this was our first time staying here , and during Covid . Room was amazing , spacious, clean, and couldn't have asked for more, comfy king bed , air cleaning system in the room ( we had a suite, was set up as a studio with living room and 1.5 baths, couch and TVs in every room ) Stayed in the Delano tower , had a large clean dog relief area which was convenient for us as we brought the dog . Where it fell off was food and beverages at the pool. Buffalo dip, 13$ and terrible, chips togo in a plastic box and the dip packaged togo as well. It looked like a cheese dip you'd buy from 7-11. Cheeseburger and fries were good (20$) , veggies came on the side ( didn't ask for that ) and all condiments on the side packaged togo. So you had to make your entire burger yourself out of a box . Mind you, we didn't ask for any of it togo so we had to take everything out and eat like that . Just not really what you want to do when your spending 50$ on dip and burger but we managed . They were out of the Souvenir mug I wanted so that was a disappointment . Overall we'd return and enjoy another stay there ."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"The Waldorf Astoria is by far one of the best hotels on the strip and one of the best hotels you can visit during the pandemic, especially for people who don't gamble like me.The uber/lyft pick up is right downstairs. You don't have to walk for 15 minutes to go to one of the 3 lobbies that is dedicated for rideshare. If you intend to uber/lyft to places outside of CityCenter, the WA is one of the best hotels to stay at. The water closest is clutch. When asking for more towels (for people like me who don't need their room cleaned every day), there's a door outside your room that connects to a space in your closet that allows room service to drop things off, like towels. This was really convenient for me as no one knocked on my door while I was on a meeting call.Additionally, the separate closet area is huge, probably too large for me. It had a nice space to open your luggage, so a luggage rack wasn't needed. It was nice having a separate closet area so that you aren't in view of your clothes the entire stay.The bathtub and bathroom is awesome. A lot of hotels, especially if they're old, have showers that leak, but the WA's bathtub was very enjoyable. The internet is fast - I was downloading at about 10MB/s, which is way more I get at other hotels. This allowed me to hop on Zoom calls with ease.As a Diamond member, I had $50 of credits a day. However, they only had one cafe open - Zen Cafe. The food wasn't bad at all. My only complaint was that the large coffee cost $10, but it was pretty much free.When I stayed in Vegas, the WA was at a similar price to the Bellagio, which is dated and gross compared to the WA. If you don't gamble, consider staying here."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas is an gorgeous hotel on the Strip, in the center of everything while seeming like it's not even in Vegas.  You can walk out your door, cross a bridge and suddenly you're in Aria or the Cosmo - but while you're inside, it feels like you're staying in a secluded, high end luxury resort.  There's no smoke-filled air, crowded casino floor, or lines at the pool (during COVID times on the weekend we were here, each couple had their own side of the pool).  This is a huge contrast to other hotels, where we saw lines of people waiting for their turn to sit poolside.  The privacy and the ability to sit 20 feet away from anyone else while enjoying a cocktail (try the spa water!) with your mask off doesn't come cheap.  You're not going to find the $5-80/night deals going on at the casino hotels at the Waldorf, but you're not going to find the crowds of people taking advantage of those deals either.  Masks are required, and the rowdy drunken crowd is nowhere to be seen.The rooms themselves are gorgeous.  We stayed in a Strip View King.  Beds were very comfortable, bathtub was giant and the staff will send up bath salts to your room if you ask (they've removed them temporarily because of COVID).  Hilton Diamond status didn't score us an upgrade during our stay, but we did get $50 resort credit each day which went toward drinks at Skybar (again very professionally spaced out and safe) and our poolside relaxation.  You apparently could use this for breakfast at Zen Kitchen as well, but who wakes up in time for breakfast in Vegas?Another perk was use of the House Car, which we used instead of an Uber to get back to the airport at the end of our stay (don't forget to tip!).All in all, we definitely felt safe here despite COVID19.  The Waldorf's my new go-to hotel whenever we end up in Vegas."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"Wonderful stay at the WA LV! As always, they were perfectly accommodating. We had a perfect view of the strip without truly feeling like we were a part of the craziness of Las Vegas, which is the vibe we were going for. They were great with cleanliness and COVID-19 precautions. We were bummed the champagne vending machine wasn't in functioning order, but still a cool touch. Staff was helpful and friendly. Worth the splurge!"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"This hotel is amazing. From the customer service to the stunning views. During these hard times they've managed to melt the stress away with sanitation stations throughout the property, mask kits are provided in your rooms and they have a ""valet"" closet for contactless service to provided you with any toiletries request. The pool attendants sanitized the beds after every guest use. Front desk was very helpful. Especially Jeremy. Thank you for all your help during my stay. I will definitely be returning."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"The Afternoon Tea was available in Gluten free, & took place in a cheek as well as comfortable room. I would recommend for both the experienced as well as notice tea drinker. Do note that attire should be at least dressy casual or above."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"If I could give a zero, I would. Out of all the luxury hotels and resorts in the world I have been to, this is the worst, I would have rather stayed at a roach motel than stay here. Some employees are extremely kind and sincere with a level of service that fits the brand. Unfortunately, during covid-19 you would expect to see more thorough cleaning and less excuses. Even the manager was rude when he had called to see why I was unhappy. I wasn't expecting much due to covid-19, but I don't expect rudeness accompanied by an excuse that its covid-19 and I should except rudeness. You should be trying harder to be polite during this pandemic, instead of using it as a means to not do your job. We only went to Vegas to show support, we don't gamble, we don't drink, we don't do what most would in Vegas. Upon arrival we already got eye rolls, then a room key that didn't work, and then a room filled with previous guests (yes, plural) hairs everywhere! Fingerprint smudges on commonly used areas of the room as well.  It's bad enough if that happened not during a pandemic, but it's extremely scary to think during a pandemic, that you would even see hairs and fingerprints everywhere, and this is a Junior suite.....Like I said, I wasn't expecting amenities, I was expecting 100% normality, I was expecting cleanliness accompanied with sincerity and dash of professionalism. I will not ever stay at any Waldorf Asoria again because of this or any Hilton brand. I should have stayed with my Luxury Collection or Ritz Carlton. The Marriot brand knows better and does better."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"You know those villains in all the James Bond films? The ones who map out their plot for world domination in a spectacular setting, complete with telepathic servants who shimmy in and out without a word? Yeah. Kind of like that. Only better."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"Beautiful hotel on the strip. Great customer service and beautiful room with an amazing view. Even during COVID times, our weekend away felt a bit normal. The place was spotless, they were attentive to our needs and requests, the pool was not packed at all, and the cafe had delicious food! Really love that this hotel doesn't have a casino, it's a beautiful place to stay on the strip and not feel like you're in the craziness of Vegas. Would definitely recommend"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"How can I start off? Let's just say I checked in on September 20, 2020 @ 3pm and was put into 3 different rooms because of housekeeping issues. Finally after 2 rooms the 3rd room I ended up taking which still had some problems. The Manager at the front desk was very apologetic but after reading other reviews I see that this hotel is starting to become a 1 star hotel. Anyway I go up to my 3rd room which is 2219, the room has no alarm clock, tv remote missing, a/c that doesn't even get cold, no hot water. I can keep going on. But I managed to make things work. The only downside about this whole situation was no upgrades or comps were given due to my situation. Nothing. Do I recommend this hotel? it's hard to say, but in all honestly I will say NO. Stay else were. Oh btw you have to drag your luggage up 2 different elevators to get to your room. WHO Designed this place? Plus the main lobby is on the 23rd floor. I have no idea why anyone would build a hotel that has a lobby on a 23rd floor. I'm guessing mandarin oriental thought it was smart when it's just plain stupid. I do not recommend this hotel."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,Glad to be at this hotel this time in Vegas. 1) Great hospitality 2) Great amenities 3) Great food 4) Great room 5) Great location with a view I highly recommend this place if you want a more chilled and relaxed stay. I love how everything was clean and smoke free zone. A lovely pleasant smell throughout the hotel. I like it! Thank you for a relaxing Vegas weekend. I hope you give this hotel place a try. Cheers! The simple things in life.
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"Center of everything. Waldorf Astoria in Las Vegas did not disappoint. Perfect location, easy access to everything that Vegas has to offer. The service, the views, the experience was all superb and more. Was kind of bummed I only stayed here two nights, wish I could of stayed longer, but that only means I will be back and stay here again."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"This hotel is now unsafe and understaffed. The entrance to the hotel had no visible security which allowed Vegas ""nightlife"" to congregate out front and threaten my wife while waiting for food delivery. Needless to say, sanitation becomes a concern then as well. We booked an expensive room. There were zero food options onsite before 5pm. After 5pm, the skybar was the only option and was basically bar food. The furnishings in the penthouse are dated/damaged as is the technology in the room. TV in living room did not work properly. Again, this is in the penthouse which one would think is well maintained. Not so much...Bottom line, Vegas is not a good place to visit right now. If you have to stop and stay and are wanting to put your trust in a luxury brand like the Waldorf - don't! It's just as bad if not worse."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,Came for the weekend. Staff was attentive. They have covid precautions in place.  They have a valet closet in the room so you have contact less drop off of items. Send texts to help you communicate. The beds are soft with plush pillows. Had a nice soaking tub tank they had Ferragamo bath products. The pools are 4 ft deep and there is a general qnd an adult pool. Also the food at the pool and cafe were really tasty. In addition to the sushi bomb the roasted chicken and pesto salad was delicious!
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"**This review is specifically on the yoga class that I took at Waldorf Astoria. I was in Las Vegas for the weekend and wanted to fit in my yoga practice. I googled local yoga studios in the area, but my search led me to places off the Strip. I did a bit more research and found that Waldorf Astoria offered yoga classes in their fitness center. What was great was that the yoga classes were open to non-guests. The drop-in price for non-guests was $35, otherwise guests could attend the classes for free. Since I was staying at another hotel, I did pay the drop-in price. I did think it was a bit pricey, but I figured what would be the difference if I had to pay for drop-in AND round trip Uber/Lyft rides if I went to a yoga studio off the strip? I would end up paying something around the same if not more. Waldorf Astoria's fitness center was located on the 8th floor. In order to access this floor, I had to go up to the Sky Lobby on the 23rd floor and then take a guest elevator to the 8th floor. A bit of a trek to finally get to the fitness center, but the studio room specifically used for personal training and group fitness classes was well worth it. The room had such stunning views of the Strip! My class was on Friday at 8:30am, and my instructor's name was Mary Jane. She led an all-levels vinyasa / power yoga fusion type of class. I thought the flow was very beautiful, and I loved that strength poses and core work were incorporated into it. The room wasn't heated, but I definitely worked up a sweat. By the way, Mary Jane was such a wonderful person. She was friendly, welcoming, and helpful as she assisted with the check-in process. You'll love her as a teacher! She also teaches pilates at the Waldorf Astoria fitness center."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"I spent the weekend at the Waldorf for a birthday treat. The staff was amazing, just friendly, professional not because they had to be it was just a natural feeling. Social distancing rules in place and we still had a wonderful experience, no crowds, the sky bar is very nice, the view in the evening is also amazing. I really do not do reviews often however I need to more often. I look forward to my next stay"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"Lovely clean hotel.... very quiet and tranquil. I'm sure this is the vibe they wanted when the Hilton took over this property. Check In is on the 23rd floor and this floor is also where the restaurants/tea room and sky bar is located. I'm not a fan of the different elevators you have to take depending on what floor you need to go on. It's a little inconvenient and can be confusing at first. One set of elevators for the restaurants/gym/spa and then another for the hotel rooms. There are also residents who live in the designated section of the hotel.Our room was spacious, loved the bathroom with the tub and the view is very nice from our window. I also enjoyed the fitness center and took a Pilates class with their onsite full time fitness instructor Mary Jane. Another highlight was the SkyBar, gorgeous views of the Vegas strip and trendy Vegas chic. This hotel is for those who enjoy privacy, non smoking and sophistication."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"My friends and I came here for their afternoon tea. At $51 per person, it was expensive. The view on the 23rd floor was beautiful, though. I did like how my friends and I could share the different teas we picked. My favorite was the tea I ordered (of course, lol), which was the masala chai. When mixed with milk and sugar, it was delicious. I loved the spices that came through in this tea. I drank my whole teapot, which by the way was huge.When we got to the tea snacks, not all of the items were tasty. When you think about the price of the afternoon tea here, everything should be great. My favorite of the tea snacks had to be the savory sandwiches on the bottommost tier. The two best tea sandwiches were their salmon and egg salad sandwiches. They had the most punch, and the egg salad was pleasantly creamy. The middle tier of scones wasn't too bad. They were much denser than the pillowy scones I've had at the Peninsula hotel in Hong Kong. The clotted cream here wasn't as good as the Peninsula either. I do have to say, I did enjoy the strawberry jam here. I drenched my scone with this jam every chance I got. By far, my least favorite tier was the dessert plate at the top. The worst was the lemon lime tart. It was too sour, and the lime flavor tasted fake. The other three desserts (see menu pic) were too bland or had flavor combinations that didn't go together in my opinion. Do I think their afternoon tea was worth it? Probably not. I would rather pay for the snack items that I did like. I wished they could've served an afternoon savory sandwiches and tea set. That would've been perfect. Otherwise, I think I might try other afternoon tea spots for comparison when I do come back to Las Vegas."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,This hotel is beautiful and peaceful but here are some issues that I want to bring up.  -Bathroom TV didn't work and was apparently under renovation.  No one told us at check in and it was not until I tried to take a bath and watch some TV that I realized that it was going to be a no go.  -No ropes in the room -No in-room dining -No turn down service -Was promised contactless check in but never received the text to proceed with that.  -Cost of strip view is $50 extra and we only got a partial view.  I feel that it's deceiving to charge extra for a view but instead I got to look at Excalibur.  -Nickel and dimed everywhere -Bath salts and coffee/tea upon request only.  If you were new to the brand then you would never even know it was available-Gym closes at 4 which sucks because check is in at 4 and check out is at 11 or 12 which doesn't leave much time for working out-Pool closes at 6 and same philosophy as above applies-There are no chargers by the bed and the only USB charger was broken.Positives:-Quiet and away from the craziness-Very good customer service-Bath amenities by Salvatore Ferragamo smell like heavenI understand things are different as we are in COVID but charging a $50 resort fee and getting nothing for it is ridiculous.  I would definitely like to stay here during normal times and see if the issues mentioned above will be addressed.
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"LOVED this hotel!!! It was like an oasis of tranquility. A few small hiccups but everyone was extremely accommodating and friendly. Service was 5 star for sure! The room was large. The bed was comfy. The bathroom is well laid out. There is the additional evening Maid service. I once forgot to turn off my Do Not Disturb button; when I called housekeeping at the end of the day, they were very responsive to clean my room. I also left notes for the housekeeping several days and they were on it. Amenities ware high end. My skin was silky smooth after using the body wash and lotion a couple of days. LOVED the gym! It had two flexibility machines I've never seen. It was spotlessly clean. There were enough cardio that I never waited and I went at all different times. They had the Kenisis machines which I had not done in a long time and I enjoyed that variation in my workout. They lowered the shades in the morning to block the glaring sun. Two kinds of water, plenty of plush towels, and disposable disinfectant wipes.Some minor hiccups... The elevators take a couple of days to figure out. There are two banks and they have different buttons. Reception is on the top floor. They became a conversation starter as everyone had the same experience. The lights in the room are a bit confusing. Master was not always master? Checkin was a little frustrating. Came here early and they said the room would be ready at 1pm. Lauren checked me in and took care of a lot of items. Came back at 1:15 and Michael said 15 more min; it was ready but needed to be inspected. Came back at 2pm -and waited while they checked many things. She said the room was ready and they were taking the bags up it would be 8-10 min. It was 13 min but I was in my room. Changed rooms a day later for an upgrade and that went freakishly smoothly. No water 11:30pm to 5 am on my last night. This was for a maintenance/repair. A note by my door was informative so I was able to easily work my schedule so I was not impacted. The clock was off one hour in the first room.I would surely stay here again. Especially now that I figured out the elevators ;)"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,Yelp,"Finally a luxury Hilton property right on the Las Vegas Strip. Previously I visited the then Mandarin Oriental to have Afternoon Tea and was so delighted to hear about the hotel itself being rebranded as Waldorf Astoria. As a Honors Diamond member, I usually opt to stay at Hilton properties to receive benefits that neither Marriott or IHG provides at a better level. In general I enjoy staying at Waldorf Astoria properties on the basis of it being a luxury brand, impeccable service, and in addition to their usage of Salvatore Ferragamo bathe amenities. So how was my stay at this newly christened property?Much of the Mandarin Oriental interior and overall design still remain and a renovations are slated to come by year end. I was given a spacious king bedded room facing the strip and retains the Mandarin Oriental design; so I guess you can say that I experienced being in a Mandarin Oriental room? Anywho, my favorite aspect of the room was the bathroom with it's frosted glass, double vanity, slate gray wall trim, separate shower and toilet enclosures, and the best thing of all - an oval tub. I used the tub quite a lot, and though utilized the bathe salts as part of the bathe amenities. If you prefer to use other soaking amenities, shops such as Lush are a short walk away.While this property does not have its own casino, the nearest one would be the Aria and of course any other resort on the strip. The comfort of the room was enjoyable, everything from cleanliness, and the bed was a definite 100% in score. Hotel staff was courteous and kind just as you would find at other Waldorf Astoria's around the globe.Will I come back? Yes Indeed, and I cannot wait to see the newly renovated property."
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"Stayed on a Friday night and as always had a fantastic time at Delano, this hotel is my top choice when coming to Vegas. Our room was clean and the seal on the door before we walked in was a nice touch. Also the small kit on the table with sanitizer a mask and other items was a welcomed surprise.Valet is still not running but the bell desk will take your items at the valet area and too your room. Parking was easy and the check in process was a breeze. The restaurants that I normally visit are still closed and other things that I like to do are also closed but I understand why and hope that we see these places open again soon. The gaming floor was not horrible, plenty of games to play and the hotel has done a good job to keep traffic flowing and attempt to create a socially distance atmosphere, its not perfect but I feel its mainly the customers not paying attention to the systems put in place by the hotel as the reason for situations to arise. However, the mask policy is a huge item in fact if it not worn correctly the staff will let you know and that made me feel like they do care about the safety plan in place and not just getting a person in the door to spend money. Overall ill be honest and say I was a bit concerned with staying in a room on the strip but the price was right and the overall room measures put in place are good. I would stay again without any issue whatsoever, COVID 19 or not."
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"I stayed her about three years ago, and it was great. Staying during COVID, I wasn't sure what to expect. Parking was free, but no valet. This wasn't a big deal since there were plenty of parking spaces near the escalators and there was a bell desk to bring our luggage. We got an upgrade on our room, so the master bath was enormous. When we first got there, we had to wait 10 minutes in line for the elevator bank. I get that most people wanted it to just be their party in the elevator, but it seemed that EVERYONE in the entire hotel got a high floor so we all had to use the same elevator bank, making the line even longer. Then we placed our key to the elevator and a red light came on. Now, apparently, that means it is valid and you can press the elevator button. However, we didn't know that so we went back to the front desk to get the keys recoded and had to wait in another 10 minute line for the elevator. It was frustrating how much time we wasted. Red usually is a ""warning"" sign or a ""stop"" sign or generally a negative sign. So either they need to change the color to green (not sure if that's possible) or have a sign/plaque above the elevator card swipe that signifies to press the button after it turns RED. They obviously are adhering to enhanced cleaning protocols. And they are diligent about making sure everyone is wearing a mask. We had room service and ordered orange juice and Chardonnay, and the representative who answered was so sweet and knowledgeable. She knew all the right questions to ask. She even asked if we were making mimosas, and when we said yes, she sent us up some glasses as well to make it easier. We went to the Delano pool which was perfect because it wasn't crazy busy = less germs and there was plenty of staff to get us drinks. The pina colada was perfect in the hot summer sun. It was a bit confusing, however, what the mask policy was. One person told us that you have to wear the mask while sitting at your lounge chair, but then a lot of people weren't... kinda inconsistent. The beach was open but there was a long line for the lazy river. We had a great time though. The icing on top of the cake was that our room came with two very nice masks, hand sanitizer, and a stylus for key pads and such. Nice little touch."
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"I love chic hotels and the Delano did not disappoint. It had a  great ambiance, modern decor and clean. It's just a luxe hotel overall. Some staff are still furloughed so there there will be some delays in getting your questions answered but they have automated the check in process. Once you check in, a code will be sent to your phone and you can print your room key using your code. I just wish that the housekeeping department will be well informed of your desired check out time especially if it was extended, so as not to keep bothering the guests by knocking every 39 minutes inquiring of your departure time."
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"Pros: Cute hotel. Super chic. Staff was great. They had hand sanitizers, masks, and gloves in the lobby which I thought was great. Hotel suite was nice and clean. Great view.Cons: I couldn't vape anywhere at the Delano. Dellas kitchen was not open. All the seats were at least 6 ft + apart. So we had to go elsewhere for food. Room service had to be at least $100 and ended way too early. When booking room, I put 2 adults .. yet only got 1 cheap looking robe. Tv didn't have any Netflix.All in all.. it looked pretty fancy but the little details show how cheap the hotel was. I definitely won't be coming back."
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"Not the pet friendly hotel their website or other reviews boast of. so disappointed! Maybe if you want to overpay for a nice hotel room without a pet, but even then, you can get better elsewhere for cheaper I did a ton of research on hotels with the best pet amenities and finally decided upon Delano. This entire trip was for my dog's birthday. We checked in and no one paid any attention to my dog (Everest). I had to ask the check in area after I got my room keys, where the pet relief area is. It will be fun walking down a long hallway, down 16 floors and out the front to the left to let Everest out. I was eager to get to the room to see what pet amenities were there and sadly, there were none. No one asked me at check in if I needed any pet items. I called immediately to ask where the pet menu was, if I was going to get food and water bowls, or why I paid $100 extra when I could have stayed at Cosmopolitan, Trump Tower, or Vdara. It took over an hour to get anything brought up for my dog. I'm very very sad I chose this hotel. if I wanted a hotel that didn't care about my dog, I would have chosen a cheaper hotel with a view of the strip. Self parking is confusing and there are no signs directing you to the hotel. I had to ask 3 people how to get to the hotel from the parking garage. You can hear every noise from the hallway; doors closing every 5 minutes and my dog (who is not typically a barker), barking every time one of the loud heavy doors closes. I couldn't even mask the noise with the TV. I'm disgusted I spent $300 for a hotel that didn't care about my dog, and with a crappy view of rooftops. Don't stay here with your pet.Update: After I complained, they brought up a chewy pup fest box, which was super nice, adding a star to my review, but no dog bowls. I asked the gentleman again for dog bowls. He came back 20 minutes later saying they don't have dog bowls."
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"How much does quality and the feeling of safety matter to you? If you want to visit Las Vegas during these unusual times , your going to want to stay at Delano.. why you ask? The security is world class, going from Delano to Luxor to Mandalay Bay to Crystals , its amazing how much classy and well kept everything is, and I feel safe. MGM is absolutely the leader in world class attractions and legendary customer service.. Now the room here is ultra posh take a look at the photos I feel like almost afraid to touch anything because if I have any dirt on my hand it's going to show the rooms are fantastic probably the largest size rooms you're going to find anywhere except for the signature... the Bathroom is my most favorite part I cannot wait to take a bath tonight and watch me some Rick and Morty.... If you are currently considering where to stay and you have multiple options we all do please listen to me from my own personal experience it is very nice here I feel very safe and welcome and now I'm gonna go downstairs and keep taking photos because this place is spectacular...!"
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"Truly a terrible, terrible hotel. Service is abysmal, staff is impossible to find, even calling the front desk gets a busy signal for 5 minutes+. For the price, there's absolutely no reason to ever stay at this dump."
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"First time here and it's super nice from great restaurants to beach , lazy river . Rooms are super clean and inviting . Great service from all staffWill be staying here from now on."
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,This has to be the best hotel that ive stayed in so far in las vegas and ive been in at least 10 different hotels. The ammenity i like the most is the 2 bathrooms because i usually come with a small party. The rooms were nice and clean and the look and feel is very luxurious. Our stay here was veey pleasant and we had a wonderful nights sleep. We will definitely be coming back
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"Staff is rude. Came across one nice person working the entire time we were here. The security at the pool is ridiculous. He told us we have to wear a mask unless we're in the pool, so my husband and I sat on the edge with our feet in to eventually get into the pool and he rudely hand motioned us to get in the pool completely. We shrugged our shoulders because we were confused (we aren't children, you can use your words sir) so he walked over and said you have to be completely submerged in the pool or else you have to wear a mask...and then patted my husband on the back....!!! Excuse me? We have to wear a mask sitting on the edge of the pool but you can TOUCH us with your nasty gloves?? Not okay. Inside the hotel they say you can only take your mask off when you're eating, drinking or smoking. We gladly followed the rules! But it got really confusing and frustrating when a staff member yelled at us for having our masks off while eating icecream. None of it makes sense and they don't even know what they're enforcing! Rules are all over the place and they aren't nice about it AT ALL. We left a day early and won't be returning.Also, there was (nasty) stains on the artwork in the living room of the suite. Picture attached. Disgusting!!"
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"Husband and I enjoyed our stay at Delano! The staff was so friendly from the front desk, bellmen, room service and housekeeping. There was always sanitizer available around the hotel and someone offering a mask if you didn't have one. The rooms were BEAUTIFUL! Modern decor, SPACIOUS, clean, and inviting. With my husband being on crutches from a recent injury and brining our 13 month old baby, we were most concerned with not needing to leave the hotel for the 3 days we stayed and Delano/Mandalay Bay was the perfect choice. Restaurant options were great, the pool/beach was relaxing and we didn't need to leave the hotel. It was the perfect quick family getaway."
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,Pretty disappointed with this place. It is pet friendly but it's a small patch of Astro turf and in the 107 degree heat it smelled awful. The need to spray it down. How about some shade? We asked several staff members about the Delano pool and received a different response each time. Yes we can use the pool at the Mandalay but it was overly crowded and we turned away. Turns out Delano does not have their own pool? We were not told that when we called in to book our rooms. Might I suggest you take reservations for the pool at the time of booking so it controls the crowd? Disappointed our kids could not use the amenities after paying almost 1000.00 for 2 nights and it was 107 degrees out. Pet friendly: would not come back here due to limited access and we were told by the front desk we can take them to the pool side grill and other restaurants. Turned out that was false.Pool access during covid: not crowd controlled well. Restaurants: all of them at the Delano was closed. Some were open at the Mandalay but closed by 9pm. WHAT? We wandered around at 11pm trying to find food- hope you like subway because that was your only option. Not even room service was availableBell Hop- these folks were amazing and I would highly recommend you give them some kudos. Standing outside in the heat and always greeted us as we walked past their station.
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"With the Mandalay Bay/Delano and MGM Grand just recently being sold to Blackstone Group, I hope nothing changes in terms of quality and service. With the MGM Groups attempt to make a big splash in the Japan Gambling Market the company was forced to take a huge financial move recently by literally selling off some of its most popular and valuable properties.If anything else, thanks for all the good times!"
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"Having stayed in practically all 4 and 5 star resorts on the strip I must say the Delano upgrade to the former Hotel of Mandalay Bay was done right. The rooms are very comfortable with all white and off white tones. The suites are just the perfect amount of space to relax and unwind. There are three TVs that keep you preoccupied and hooked on watching the next game or race if you're a degenerate gambler hahahaha... Or for those who follow the stock market, the crawlers are always moving. The Keurig is a great addition and I especially enjoy the sunken tub that is separate from the shower. I'd be back again but not on a mega fight weekend as this is between Mayweather and Pacquiao. The valet is located in the rear and same with the registration.I ended up leaving a polo shirt and my swim trunks in the room and went back to pick it up and was told it was not available for pickup! How could you lose my Lacoste Polo and dirty add swim trunks in the span on an hour!? Overall a great hotel but bad internal controls especially for lost and found items... Smh"

Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"The worst customer service with horribly maintained rooms. The hallways smelled like sewer, there was no cold water in the shower and there was a buzzing noise coming from the bathtub (sounded like it was going to explode).  We didn't figure out that the cold water didn't work and the buzzing noise until we got back at midnight and started to wash up.  We called guest services at midnight and they said they would send an engineer. We waited 15 minutes and called again and they told us to wait. We waited another 15 minutes and asked for the manager.  The manager told us that they were having plumbing problems and had to move us. This is after waiting for over 30 minutes!  Why didn't they tell us when we first called? She didn't even apologize and told us to move. We packed all our stuff and moved to another room. We get to the new room and was getting ready to sleep again.  My husband sat on the couch to find out that it was soaking wet! It was disgusting!!  We called guest services again and they told us that they didn't have the same room but a similar room and asked us to move. We had it! And good luck getting through guest services. We waited at least 5 minutes until someone answered the phone."
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"The WORST WORST HORRIBLE service EVER! Paid in advance for 2 queen bedroom for 2 nights, Came in after check in around 7pm and this ""resort "" did not have our room ready....wanted to put my family in a king size bed with a cot (""roll a way bed"") for my daughter to sleep in. This is UNACCEPTABLE!!!  I will NEVER EVER come to this crumby resort again! Lame lame lame!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"I would give a 5 star except...2 reasons its not.1. The front desk phone service SUCKED my shortest wait time on hold to front desk was 16 minutes bc it then disconnected the longest was 30 minutes in which they informed me it would be an hour until they could bring water to the room!2. The wave pool (which has always been my family's FAVORITE part of Delano/Mandalay Bay) has done something to make their waves smaller. I felt like they barely rippled up much at all, it felt like a little kid wave pool... even my 10 year old said the waves were smaller now. Then we overheard another couple saying the same thing that the waves were smaller now :( disappointing as that is our favorite part of this hotel.The room was great as always and the view of the strip fun to look at at night. Comfy beds & pillows. Great WiFi.House of Blues restaurant in casino is delish!"
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,"DO NOT STAY HERE IF YOU WANT TO RELAX AT THE POOL!We watched the situation in Vegas carefully leading up to our reservation date in October 2020 and called the hotel two days prior to our arrival to get clarification on the mask policy throughout the property, including the pool.We were told what we expected, that masks were required throughout the hotel/casino unless eating or drinking and when walking around on the pool deck but if you were in your cabana or pool chairs you could remove them.When we arrived at 10am, the check in process was a bit of a mess.  We requested a room on the same floor as friends we were traveling with and were told that wouldn't be a problem but our room still needed to be cleaned and we should get a text in a hour or two.  Fast forward to 4pm and still no text so we called the front desk and they say they don't have record of our reservation.  I showed them my booking info and the previous text I received from the hotel and they finally found us but with a room assignment on a different floor than our friends even though the reservation was noted to be the same floor.The following day we decided to go to the pool,  which like a lot of resorts, is a lengthy walk from the rooms.  When we arrived we attempted to order drinks and bill them to our room but were told there was no credit card on file for our room.  Obviously this can't be true because you need one to check in but they made us walk back to the front desk to fix the issue.  After getting our steps in for the day we made it back to the pool, ordered drinks and sat down on our chair.  When we took off our masks to drink our drinks we were told we had to pull them up in between sips and keep them on 100% of the time if we were in our chairs and not eating/drinking.  I asked if this was a new policy in the last 48hrs and was told it had been that way for over a month and it was a state mandate.We were not happy about this but complied because we had no choice and opted to stay in the water to be able to have our drinks and drink them without masks.  There were dozens of pool employees there to make sure the mask policy was followed and they were oppressive in their enforcement.  Getting out of the water to dry your face?  Put your mask on!  Walking to the water to get in?  Where is your mask?  Even though we were complying with their rules we were each asked about our mask dozens of times each during our time at the pool.  The following day we made our way back down to the pool to discover that two of the pools were closed for maintenance so everyone that didn't want to be in the wave pool had to cram into a single pool.  The bar next to the pool was also closed so we had to rely on a servers to get us drinks.  There were two servers for 100+ people and they tried their hardest but we were lucky to see them once every few hours.  Still 20 employees standing around waiting to pull your mask up in between sips of beer though...It got so ridiculous that we decided to check out non MGM hotel pools on the strip to see if it was the same everywhere and we found that it was not.  All three other hotels we visited had more reasonable mask rules so it seems that hotels are interpreting the mandate in different ways. We ended up paying for day passes to go to another pool and had a wonderful time.  We did bring up our concerns to management and they told us their employees shouldn't be so oppressive with mask rules but that they were seasonal employees and would only be there another two weeks so there wasn't much they could do... Really??After this experience we will never be staying at an MGM property again."
Delano Las Vegas,Yelp,The Delano is. A great place to stay.  The view of the city was great outside the window.  The rooms were clean and they smell excellent when you walk in.  The customer service of the staff was great.  It also had a lot of restaurants and great places to eat The reasons I gave it a 4 is because it was not on the strip.
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"WOW!!!All I can say is WOW!!!This is by far the best sushi restaurant in Vegas.The service is tops. Well worth the cost.A+ NOBU!!!I will be back with friends.Sincerely,Brian"
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"I've been staying at the Hotel 6-7 times over the last 4 years where my first 3 stays were at the Sake Suite, Hakone Suite, then the smaller suite, and despite the latter being smaller, I completely found the room to be immensely charming.  That is, until our last stay where I was greeted by 3 cockroaches within a two night span on 3 different occasions. Now, It's very sad for me to have to do this considering how I literally recommended the Nobu hotel to all my friends, which resulted in our stay at the Nobu Hotel just a few weeks back (July 25th, 2020).  Typically, I, a regular at the Nobu, was very quick to help Nobu cover their tracks with basic excuses such as ""ahhh, they've been closed due to the Covid so the cockroach predicament is unavoidable during these times.""  Sure enough, all my friends went with it which displayed their best side of forgiveness imaginable. Problem solved, right?  Well, I thought so until one of my friends jokingly mentioned the cockroach to the front desk clerk who was quick to dismiss the both of us.  My initial reaction was ""She must be having a bad day."".  I came back a little later and mentioned it again to a second host because the last response really left a bad taste in my mouth, and low and behold again, I was dismissed by the second staff.  Then I thought, ""wow, I must be having a bad day.""   3 weeks later, which leads us to today, I found that I have a meeting in Vegas at the end of this month so I thought to call Nobu and work something out with their manager since surely they are a lot more understanding than their help.  Realistically, my goal was to perform a principle-check to see if Nobu's standards were up to snuff.  I, at the very least, would appreciate an explanation as to why I had received a blatantly short & quasi-careless dismissal, and also the complete ignorance to the cockroaches as though they were not allowed to mention the word.  I even showed these guys videos and pictures of the cockroaches, and also mentioned that we weren't the only ones complaining, so I truly do not get why they are acting as though the cockroaches do not exist. To make a long story short, after having been transferred nearly 4 times, and basically hung up on, and had to repeat my story again, all the while being extremely patient, a male clerk finally said to me... ""do you want money or something?""   I was appalled?  ""What??? Why would you say it like that?""  I'm giving you chance to save our relationship and this is the response I get? ""Well, we can offer you a $51 resort fee for one night as compensation"" to which I declined.  I simply told them if $51 is what you think this situation is worth, then I'll go ahead and post this story to everyone on the internet, which they totally blew me off.  Hmmm..  Be it what it may, a hotel chain like this has got to be smarter than that.  Transparency and honesty has always been the best policy, so for me not to receive those, I literally am going out of my way to write my very first ever hotel review.  Talking about love & hate.  Maybe they're going through some tough times and really needed the extra cash.  Whatever it is, I sure hope one day Nobu decides to change up their policy and really keep their customers happy cause I would love to see them succeed.  In the meantime, I'll be sure to post this to as many platforms as possible because we all got to get to the bottom of this cockroach thing so Las Vegas' health department could help Nobu in getting rid of the cockroaches."
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,I like the vibe and comfort of The Nobu Hotel. The staff was friendly and very informative. The room was clean and spacious. The bed  was very comfortable and smell fresh. The location is central the shops and Caesars Forum.I will be back!
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"12/30/19: My favorite part about the Nobu hotel is the location of the entrance. The entrance of the hotel is nestled between the Nobu restaurant, Montecristo cigar bar, and high limit slots... my favorite spots in Caesars. The room views are typically nothing special since the full strip view rooms are limited. The room itself is clean... but nothing special. Stayed here a few times and each time, the shower head didn't work properly (not a big deal). I do appreciate that the fridge next to the gym on the 72nd floor is always kept stocked with complementary bottles of water. Ordered room service yesterday which was hit or miss. Ordered a burger 'medium' with sauce on the side (the bf hates mayo). Not only did they put the sauce on the side... they put it on the burger! Had to scrape off as much as I could to convince him to eat it. The burger itself was overcooked and the bun was worthless... completely fell apart after the first few bites! Ordered a large sparkling water but it didn't bother to come with ice. The burger came with several small bottles of condiments... the typical individual Heinz ketchup, mustard, mayo, and Tabasco. What really ticked me off was that the bottle of Tabasco was not only used... but was empty! Unacceptable! On a better note, the ramen was excellent. Large portion, great flavor, and very filling. I would most definitely order this dish again!Also I should mention, I was very disappointed when I wasn't greeted with the usual welcoming gift in the room. Like I said, the experience is hit or miss."
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"A very nice hotel but there are rooms at a much better value available in Las Vegas. Nobu Hotel is basically a boutique hotel nestled inside Caesars Palace or at the minimum that is what Ceasars Palace would have you think. I would say it is just Ceasar's ""more expensive"" rooms. I actually was upgraded to Nobu for free during a convention which was appreciated but after staying a pair of nights, I can confidently say the extra coin isn't worth it.Don't get me wrong, the rooms are a huge step up in regards to the furnishings and ambiance plus they even have a welcome gift which is appreciated. There is also a separate lobby so you are not stuck in line with the 'peasant-class"" persons stuck in ""every day"" Ceasars Palace as well as a free lounge area and no-cost access to the famous Ceasars Palace pool. I just cannot imagine paying a premium for any of this personally as the money is better invested in meals, shows, and -- possibly -- gambling (you got me - I am not a gambler). I did enjoy the lemongrass scent in the elevator since it cut out the scent of cigarette smoke and the shower was outright lavish. The unusable fridge and lack of drawer space both detract from the experience. Considering the pay to play equation, I am lukewarm on Nobu Hotel's value prop."
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"Seriouly only 3.5 stars?! I love this hotel because of the Japanese Style minimalist decor and the amazing bed. . . Organizing and cleaning the room twice a day. Besides you're gonna have access to the Cesar Palace Poll (which is soo beautiful!) with no extra fee, Casinos, Shops and Restaurant and you can make early chek-in with no extra fee too.Elevators are modern and very fast. I just DO NOT reccomend the Nobu Restaurant as is really very expensive with slow service, tiny amount and ordinary sushi/ meal. Instead try Bacchanal Buffet!!I thought this hotel was good deal from Expedia."
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"(Pretext - I frequent the bellagio, aria, cosmo, mandarin, & wynn.)The great bits: It is extremely close to some of the favorite shopping and food spots. The room was lovely and quite large but it was lacking a tub.The next bits: Check in was separate from the Caesar's mob-scene with one person. I felt badly for the understaffed area as there was a line of 7 parties including us, waiting. The person holding the Nobu staff's attention had some special case of ""room-comp"" and I think it was taken all the way to Nobu himself to resolve. We waited 20 minutes to talk to someone. Check in is at 4p and check out is at 11a; hours cut on both sides and we couldn't even extend our room on a Wednesday to 12noon check out but more on that another day. The ""smart-elevator"" crashed on us at least 3 times during our 4 day stay there. There was a nice email with our ""dedicated concierge"" but then radio silence the day of arrival and after. The room ran out of tissues and called down to the front desk. They said house-keeping will come up. This was around 9pm and no one came up. Walls were thin; heard all sorts of sports watching, hammer-banging, sink-fixing noises at 930pm - lovely!House-keeping crew knocked on our door at 9am the day of our check out - did they not get the message we were trying to pack and leave? The fire extinguisher was rusted beyond recognition (see pic) and I wonder if it still works. Our rooms did not have consistent number of towels - one day I ran out of bath towels and then another day we were flush with hand towels. Vanity kits and bath gels/shampoos/conditioners were not replenished at all and there was never any lotion in the room so I had to ask for some when I saw the crew in the hallway. Went down to the ""business"" center and waited 10 minutes for them to replenish the coffee at 845am. There was no fruit or any other cute nobu-branded things in there. The gym was very nice - clean and plenty of water however there were no extra towels (one per machine) and I took the last of the free earplugs for the machines.For those that think this place is great, good for you! Go back again."
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"My last Vegas hotel experience prior to Nobu was A BUST.  Long lines to check in, gross room product in need of an update, blah casino, you get the picture.  So when we booked our flights back to Vegas, I told my husband my expectations and he made it happen. This boutique hotel inside of Caesars Palace really fit the bill for us. Beautiful room product, GREAT gym with Pelotons! Access to Caesar's great pools, restaurants, central location, shopping and casino. NO LINE TO CHECK IN!!!!  Desk staff was friendly and answered all my questions.   I will note we arrived late, and the next morning I noticed that housekeeping had missed a few things in our room. I didn't make a big deal of it and maybe I should have, and there was one day where they didn't come clean the room. So that's the loss of the star there. I never understand how that happens, as someone who has worked in hotels and cleaned rooms! Whatever.  Since this is a Harrah's property you do get your points from staying here.  I'd recommend it, and I think we will stay here again."
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"My fiance and I, visited Nobu Hotel in Caesar's Palace. The rooms are gorgeous. The in-room dining is an absolute must! The extra amenities were absolutely terrific! What made our stay especially outstanding was the nicest staff in the world. To begin, Jonathan from Maintenance, came by to check a minor issue our room experienced. He was quick to diagnose the issue, gave us a couple of options to remedy the problem, and was so polite that I had to insist he have a seat to relax from his hard work. He started us on a good vacation. Continuing on, we had the excellent service from Warly (Staff). He attended to our needs and would bring extras (hot water, tea, ice, etc.) Before we even asked. He was attuned to what we would require far in advance of us even considering it. Warly was also so kind, so considerate, and even took the time to make polite conversation. He alone would have made our trip 5 stars for his exceptional customer service. Last but far from least, Manager Joshua Prince completely made my birthday so remarkable. He personally helped to relocate my fiance and I when we experienced the room inconvenience. He communicated properly and paid attention to what our problems were and fixed everything with incredible speed and skill. Josh went above and beyond with his service, demeanor, and leadership. On our way out, he made sure we had enjoyed our stay and inquired if we needed anything else. He is a major reason we will come back to Nobu in the future (and frequently)! The staff here is amazing beyond belief and we were stunned at the high quality experience they provide"
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"I wouldn't recommend it. It's like an upscale motel. The amenities in the room are great, the lounge room with free drinks is great, but the room was small and dark with a gross view out the window. They tried to give us a room with 2 beds, even though we booked the ""Deluxe King"" room. When we got to the room, we noticed it had 2 beds. They said we have to read the small print when we make reservations. What a scam. I never read the small print when I book at other hotels. They said our room type for which we paid, isn't available. We insisted on getting the room type we booked, then all of the sudden they were wrong. Our king room was suddenly available. Strange. Stay at Caesars or a hotel that doesn't keep dolphins and wild animals captive in a hotel setting. Oh, the very weak shower pressure made me want to be home. Here's a photo of our view."
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"Was here in late 2018 with my bf . Service,  experience was AMAZING. So I booked a room for a ""mini- moon"" to my new sister in law and rave how excellent Nobu was.  They checked in today  (7/17/19) on their wedding day and only two double bed was available, after a king was requested.  When they requested for toiletries,  it was all delivered in a trash bag. From what I recalled  it was professionally delivered in a tray .I feel so embarrassed."
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"I did not even know this hotel existed before my boyfriend surprised booked it for our thanksgiving mini vacay in Vegas. From the moment we arrived at the desk at the private elevators we were amazed. They pipe in a lemongrass ginger smell that, yes can be a bit overwhelming, but is so much better than the cigarette smoke all over the casino. We were shown to a private check in desk and helped by Tracy. She was beyond helpful. Our flight landed at 7am and we were in a room with a view by 8am. There is a private little lounge with complimentary water, coffee, tea. A gym with towel service and a bathroom. Also computers, couches and a tv for relaxing. Our room was beautiful. Various robes and slippers were on display. The bathroom was amazing!  Huge, beautifully appointed with a rain shower.  The TV was massive!  There was a safe in the closet. Ironing board and iron. Turn down service was prompt and everyone we encountered at Nobu Hotel was a step above! My only complaints are there are no drawers in the bedside tables. None. No drawers in the bathroom. None. The drawers in the dresser are full of expensive snack bar items, tea kettle and the fridge is locked with more expensive items. So storage is at a minimum to say the least. No useable fridge, no microwave.  The pools were mostly closed for construction so that was a disappointment. There is no tub in the room and no hot tubs at any of the pools. A foot soak would've been nice after all of that walking. Overall I would definitely stay here again. Just for the service alone."
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"My stay at Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace was very pleasant. I arrived in Las Vegas around 1:00pm and called Caesars Palace and asked about the early check in, I was told once I arrived they would be able to let me know if my room was ready. Caesars Palace informed me that check in was at 3pm. Upon arriving to Nobu, I checked in my bags and expected to have my room ready by 3pm. I spent two hours in the hotel at a local eatery having drinks. At 3pm I made my way back to Nobu and asked if my room was ready, only then do I find out that Nobu's check in is actually at 4pm. I expressed to the clerk that I am extremely tired and I've been driving since 5am. I also let the clerk know that I have a concert to attend at The Colosseum in less than 4 hours. The clerk was extremely helpful and found a room with a king size bed that was available for check-in.The room was gorgeous and the bathroom was beautiful. After the concert that I went too was over with, I made it back to the hotel room around 9pm to find that the hotel room was cleaned (we were only in the room for 4 hours that day). When I come back to Las Vegas I will definitely be staying at Nobu!"
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"I hate leaving lower reviews but after our recent stay of 6 nights in the Nobu Palace I don't think we will be returning. Night and day difference between our stay 3 years ago.We stayed in the Saki Suite with pool table and attached room. The total for the stay was around $8,000 but when in Vegas you treat yourself right? Upon arrival everything seemed ok. We heard someone complaining about the keys and something else but paid no attention. The room is still very nice but as the woman at the desk said ""It's a bit over due for updates"" we had no butler service like our previous stay which isn't a deal breaker accept that it is supposed to be included in the price. The Elevators quit working multiple times forcing us to use the stairs and luckily we weren't to high up. At least once a day our keys would quit working and we would find ourselves locked out of the room. Most of the staff was very friendly but our group is split on the woman working the 2nd floor most days. She appeared to be management but it was a struggle to smile and it always felt like we were a hassle. The Room service was hit or miss. We had some people over our personal belongings around and then others did a fantastic job we tipped a couple of them just for being so courteous! All in all the room is still one of my favorites but the service and aging of nobu may have us looking elsewhere for a few years as it is one of the priciest and the stay certainly did not match the price!"
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"This is not a 5-star hotel as advertised. They couldn't provide the most basic of amenities. My husband attempted to surprise me with champagne and flowers in the room upon check-in for my birthday and it resulted in a late check with no flowers. The staff were not rude but they were not friendly and not the least bit accommodating. Room service was nearly impossible to order with long hold times on the phone, a text service that didn't work, and a tv-ordering system that was difficult to navigate and painfully slow. The room was fine but nothing that any average hotel chain couldn't deliver. Overall an extremely disappointing experience. We will not be staying at Nobu again."
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"Best hotel on the strip. (Skip below for room service recommendations) I've stay multiple times at Mandarin Oriental & even more times here because no one comes close.  From day one of Nobu, service has been consistently extraordinary, the exclusive food menu is impeccable & unfortunately you can't order it in the restaurant, which sucks!  The room service, ambience & the house cleaning are always on top of it.  The check-in area is not always fantastic.Things I love: -Best room service food menu is beyond belief!  -Private Elevator w/ a very unique wooden jig-saw type of design inside & Touch-Screen ABC levels.-Instead of looking at a blank wall outside of the window of your room, each wall of Caesar's outside is a different mural.  One w/ Cherry Blossoms, one w/ a beautiful mountain & beyond is the High Roller Ferris wheel or the Colosseum.-Toto Toliet w/ oscillating wash & warm seating.-A direct sport books feed of my horse racing channels directly from the race track.  -Comfy & cozy bed, large dining room, bar & huge tub!  Lovely shower w/ hot sauna feature & two large basin ceramic sinks.  Lovely wooden toothbrushes, mint toothpaste & different unique travel items.  -In the smaller rooms, they don't have as much, but they have had the cookies & tea such as in the Mandarin.  FOOD.. a must once in your lifetime.  In order of my favs!Nobu ClubNewman Ramen SoupBagel & Lox.. on a crispy rice bagel, Tofu cream & salmonRLT.. Rock Shrimp Buns Lobster RollPork Belly Tonkatsu Sandwich Tamago Yaki.. Japanese Style Omelette w/ King CrabCold Soba NoodlesPlease add the 'Club', New-Man Ramen & RLT to the Nobu restaurant!!"
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"Just  this place! Wonderful boutique Nobu hotel is so chic in style. The entrance is within Caesars right next to the Nobu restaurant, where we'll be dining tonight. The check-in was so smooth with team {Kamu & Theary}. They were so fun and offered amazing service... Even on such a busy 4th of July weekend. I am absolutely OBSESSED with the beautiful suite they got me in. It feels like I'm staying in a luxurious spa. Wish I was here forever! I'll definitely be back!"
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"I took my mom for a mother-daughter trip this weekend and we had an incredible stay at Nobu Hotel. It was our first time here, and judging from all the other reviews, I was worried that I was going to have trouble finding the place but honestly just follow the signs, which will lead you to a giant sign NOBU WAY, you seriously cannot miss it even if you try! Checking in was a breeze, the staff is very friendly and accommodating.If you're asian, you will absolutely appreciate the large hot water dispenser on the 72nd floor, where they have complimentary coffee, tea, and bottled water. At most other hotels we hate using the hot water kettle in the rooms, so this was a major bonus for us. The bathrobes are so incredibly soft, and I love the Japanese style slippers. The toiletries that came with the room smell heavenly, I even requested a few extra (the rosemary and white tea scent is to die for) and they were very accommodating. Loved the style and decor of the rooms. A modern and clean aesthetic accented with wood decor. The room was spotless, and the bathrooms were sparkling clean, it looked brand new. Normally on Vegas trips, I don't enjoy staying in the hotel rooms but we really loved spending time in the room, especially with the large leather couch. We valeted here, but next time I'm going to self-park. It's extremely easy and probably the same amount of steps as if you were to valet. Overall, I'm really pleased with my stay here, and will be making this my go-to hotel in Vegas!"
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,"Unbelievable gem inside of Caesars I had no idea about.The check-in experience was one in it's own. You let the desk know you are ready for your reservation and they send you in what seems like a secret elevator to get to the actual check-in desk.From there you are brought to a very small, quiet lobby deco'd out with Murakami prints *love* and a state of the art gym.If you're looking for a discreet and quiet getaway as soon as you hop off the strip, this is where you come to stay. Our suite was beautiful complete with a full dining table, seating area in our bedroom and a bathroom to die for. I could've spent the whole weekend in suite and not done anything and been happy.The place is bigger than my one bedroom apartment.Biggest downfall? Our check-in time was at 3pm, and we weren't able to get into our room until 5:30...so we were waiting in the lobby for that long. I was exhausted and it was my last night in Vegas, I was bummed we were wasting time. The front desk told us that the people prior to us had a late check out, but I'm sorry I don't know what that has to do with MY reservation. The room is well over $800, I think for the amount we paid, I should've been able to have an early check-in, am I right?They didn't offer us any compensation for our wasted time, which was also a bummer. ...but, beautiful place."
The Nobu Hotel,Yelp,Have been staying here a few times. Love every bit while staying. We always got an personal concierge and they give us a welcome box of goodies to munch on. Its located inside Caesars Palace.
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"PLEASANT 3 DAY STAY!-SUPER CLEAN-NOT CROWDED -SAFETY SIGNS AND SANITIZER EVERYWHERE-WIPES PROVIDED ON GAMING FLOOR -MASKS MUST BE WORN ON PREMISES AT ALL TIMES(EXCEPTIONS: IN THE POOL, AT YOUR TABLE)-RECOMMENDED ONE PARTY ON ELEVATOR AT A TIME-CLEANING CREWS AROUND THE CLOCK -CHAIRS HAVE BEEN REMOVED IN ORDER TO CREATE SPACE ON THE GAMING FLOOR PERFECT PLACE! This location has been a Go-to favorite of mine for the past three years and they still have not disappointed.After a long and 90+ day quarantine I took a leap of faith and a can of Lysol wipes and checked in for some sunshine, poolside fun and good food. Workers performing wipe downs everywhere I turned it seemed which we can all appreciate so expect to see them routinely. Burgers and Brews was delicious! Baby cakes was so yummy and thank you for providing a deliciously piping hot Cafe' Au Lait which I LOVE! (Sip carefully) Pool area was clean, the staff was great, both ladies and gentlemen were awesome. Security came by to remind me to put on my mask, oops! So they're watching closely. Thank you Thank you MAGGIE server on the gaming floor YOU ARE AWESOME! You literally rescued that crowd when it looked like drinks were impossible to getWill be Back Soon!"
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"Let's start by saying the M Resort is beautiful. I've been here before for dinner & have always wanted to experience the pool.With my better half leaving tomorrow for a couple of months, her request was to head over to her favorite pool at M Resort. Security was friendly especially entering the property. Pool staff was friendly including the VIP host & the GM of the Pool. As someone who ran one of the largest Hotels in the Country, I was shocked that at 1:30pm when we arrived that Upper Management did not want to reduce the price for a daybed or a cabana. They specifically prefaced to me that they have a lot of their daybeds available for the rest of the day. When I expressed that we arrived with half the day left & asked if we could get a half day rate. They explained that they weren't doing anything & that they would be keeping the rate flat throughout the entire day regardless of the time. Although I don't agree with it, especially since it's a loss of revenue on Recreations part & a not so great experience to start the afternoon, I do appreciate the honesty that was expressed with professionalism. We decided to pay the local fee for the day and sit at some chairs in the back. No one walks you to your seat, however I'll cough it up to the possibility that we are still in a crazy world at the moment (COVID-19). The girls at the pool hut were very polite & friendly. Our server Kiana came over to take care of us. She is also very friendly & knowledgeable. The prices for drinks are AMAZING & the amount of time it took to receive the cocktails were pretty fast considering how busy they are. All in all it was a beautiful day with beautiful friends celebrating a spectacular human being that I adore."
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"This is where I go when I go to Vegas!! I'm a chill type person and the strip to me makes me anxious now a days. M resort is GREAT , rooms are so nice. My daughter loves the large tub , Spa time The rooms are always clean and I'm happy they are extremely watching out for COVID 19 continually wiping machines and everyone wearing masks. Also this is the Raiders home stay!"
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"My overall experience with staying three days at the M resort was pleasant yet slightly annoying at the same time. Front desk and Bell service were amazing. Booking was a different animal. If you don't book online and want a certain special rate. They will not send you a confirmation via email or text. They also will bill you an extra $150 deposit once checking in. Both slightly an inconvenience but doable . The rooms are super clean but no lamps and the overhead light over the bed makes you feel like you are being interrogated  while trying to rest. The TV is small by hotel standards and difficult to operate.  No microwave but a small fridge and safe. Housekeeping starts at 9:00am and if you get passed by..PLEASE call housekeeping to request service otherwise they may show up in the late afternoon once you have returned.Everyone was wearing a mask , the pool was closed and always try to get a room with a city view because the Mountain View is depressing. Look forward to returning when everything goes back to normal."
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,Clean. This casino is fun for locals and tourists alike. Great rooms.  Buffet is closed.  Cafe ok.Clean casino but drink servers are scarce.
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"So apparently this is the Official Raider hotel.   Team Headquarters is not far from the resort.  You will see the team logo throughout the hotel. The team logo is also a part of some of the employees uniform The casino resort itself is 11 years old. However it just ""recently"" became the Official Raider Hotel. So it's not a brand new Hotel/Casino/Resort The venue is located about 20 min from the strip (we could actually see the strip from our room) and also 20 min away from the Airport We walked in the main entrance and saw a Lamborghini just parked inside the hotel WOW fancy.  The lobby area and check in area is nice and clean, very spacious and nicely decorated.  Check in was easy.  I did request robes and slippers.  I was advised they would be taken to my room shortly. GREATOur room was nice.  Nice comfy king size bed, great view of the Las Vegas Strip and the pool area.   The bathroom has an electronic mirror with a TV inside the mirror.    A nice sunk in tub and a separate shower area.  The room is nicely decorated and when you turn on the television your name appears on the TV welcoming you.  Nice touch  Initially the electronic mirror/TV in the bathroom was not working, it wouldn't turn on.   I called the front desk who told me that they would send someone up.  Ok cool Someone showed up within 5 min. Told us we needed a new remote and ""he doesn't do that HOUSEKEEPING does"" and we need to call the front desk again OKKKK ummm wow. Guess departments within the hotel do not communicate well I take it Housekeeping came gave us a new remote.  We still didn't receive the robe or slippers.  Housekeeping came back and delivered them.   Because of Covid the buffet was not open, pool closes early, not all casino bars are open, coffee makers not offered in rooms, AND NO MICROWAVE any where at all to warm up any left overs you will have.  Trust me you will have left overs We played at the slot machines for a few hours. No one ever came and offered us drinks.    We sat at the Mbar at the casino floor.    We were told to take a seat anywhere and someone would take our order.   We were the only ones sitting at a table in the Mbar area.  No other customers at any of the tables.  After 20 min of sitting there we finally spoke up. Eric apologized said he was taking the blame and blamed it on change of shift.  Idk I guess we can blame everyone's grumpy attitude on Covid.      The property itself is small (in comparison to most Las Vegas Hotel/Casino/Resorts).  Rooms are nice The main restaurants that are open during Covid are great.     Only one ""gift shop"" available that offers limited over priced alcohol. So BYOB"
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,So our last night in Vegas we stayed at this little gem of a hotel.  As you can see Vegas strip is a bit away but the hotel is close enough to downtown and located convenient to the airport.  The pool was wonderful.  Waitresses kept the Tito's punch coming.  It was relaxing and peaceful.  It will definitely be someplace we stay again in the future.
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"Stayed here one night on the way to a baseball tournament and was really blown away by the rooms.  They were really spacious with excellent appointments and a huge, fantastic bathroom.  The electronic blackout curtains and bathroom shade were special and appreciated touches.  The casino was also nice, clean and sizable but not overwhelming.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic casino/resort stay out of the hustle and bustle of the strip.  Also, everyone of the guests was diligent about wearing masks which I attribute to the management and staff setting the safety bar high."
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"Bad, Bad, Bad. High expectations big let down. I usually stay at the Westin in Henderson. I wanted to give the M a try. First room: pubic hair, stains on the towels and the furniture. Got a room change.Second room: beds undone, covid mask on night stand, bag with food trash on the stand. Change of room. Again. Third room - cup stains on the furniture. Staff had the audacity to say it was the last time they would change my room. Poor service. I would give them a negative 5 stars."
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"We live just two blocks from the M and decided on a staycation shortly after the resort opened back up. I have mixed feelings. The casino is absolutely stunning, no question about it. The restaurants aren't allOpen which is sad but understandable. The burger place there is beyond disappointing but I'll review that one separately. The rooms exceeded my expectations by far. It was a third floor room with a partial pool view. Decor was tasteful and well maintained. The pool, however was quite disappointing. You can't go up to the bar which was frustrating. You can go to the casino cage and the front desk but not the bar? I'm, ok. There was only about three waitresses servicing the entire pool area. Just seemed like they weren't interested much in alcohol sales that day. I did manage to secure a cocktail. It was a Tito's Blueberry Punch which was quite delicious. The atmosphere was ok but the pool needs a little care. I honestly felt like I was hanging out in a parking lot that happened to have a pool. The lounge chairs are in desperate need of replacing. I would imagine these more at Circus Circus than at a ""luxury"" resort. Just seemed like they don't care very much about the guest's pool experience. The M does a great job but more attention needs to be put in food quality of that dreadful burger place and the Goodwill furniture at the pool."
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"DO. NOT. COME. HERE. Unless you want to see the biggest cockroaches on the planet!!!! They were in the parking garage, in the lobby and outside in the pool area when we came to visit during the evening. These things were HUGE and I'm not very scared of bugs but I have zero desire to ever come back here again. If those things are in the main parts of the hotel, I'm mortified to think about what could be lurking in their hotel rooms! Runnnn!!!!"
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"This resort is not ready to welcome back anyone. They seriously need to get their collective house in order. I booked two stays. The problems started when reservations did not book me connecting rooms as asked. They notated the reservations and when we checked in, they gave away the rooms. Then the front desk starting complaining about their reservation agents. This caused a lot of drama, stress and anxiety within my party because the kids did not have immediate access to our room. The front desk said they would upgrade me on the second trip. In the middle of my vacation, I started getting all these charges to my Visa from the Resort. I attempted to call the front desk for clarification but was on hold for over 10 minutes... no answered!!!When I arrived for our return stay, I asked the front desk to explain all the charges. Turns out, they charged for my last stay before I even checked in!!!  Then they charged me for the first stay days later. The front desk had zero clue what was going on. So after spending all day in a car.... we head down to Burgers and Brews for an early dinner. We ask for a window table... sorry, its reserved. Not for a real guests but for a servers friends. My BASIC green salad did not come as advertised. It was missing the vegetables but I said screw it. Then, the extra crispy wings I order... cold to touch and luke warm inside. I tell them to take it back. They take too long to replace the wings so I tell them to forget it... everyone is done! Should of comp'd the whole meal, but oh, ""we took off the wings."" Damn right... you didn't deliver!!!Completely embarrassed multiple times in front of my party twice in a week. I would stay clear of this place. THEY ARE NOT READY TO BE OPENED.Update: 9pm and housekeeping just left trash and used linens in the hallway. This place is a hot mess!!!"
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"Not enforcing the mask requirements, despite many signs, and security officer is too busy chatting to another employee to notice people walking around without masks, sitting at machines with their masks under their chins. They clearly don't care about safety. Won't be going back."
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"Great rooms, nice gambling area,  M pool is great, we rented a daybed twice the 1st time we had bad shrimp so only reason they didn't get 5 stars, pool was clean service was good, front desk upgraded us On our visits since it was our first stay there and 2nd trip was my boyfriends birthday so they upgraded us a definite stay place especially if your a Raider fan"
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"What a beautiful resort. I lived in Vegas/Henderson for 6 years, and saw the M Resort often without ever going inside.In our quick trip back to visit family, we had the pleasure of staying here. It was absolutely beautiful. Everyone was friendly and professional, from check in, to the gym as well as the Baby Cakes Shop for our cheesecake that night.We had a King room in the 7th floor, looking south. It was a large room with nice views of the Foothills. All of the window shades were electric, closed/opened with a switch. The bathroom was gorgeous, with a soaking tub that allowed for you to enjoy the view through a window into the bedroom, or privacy with an electric shade. Large shower with a bench seat, dual sinks, makeup mirror and seat, water closet, iron/board and hair dryer. There is a fridge as well.Best thing...Baby Cakes downstairs is open 24/7 with cheesecake, cakes and treats. Excellent service and friendly staff.My husband utilized the gym, which is accessed through the spa. They take your room number, and you can charge purchases straight to your room. No cash needed. This was a great way to spend the last night in town. Clean, modern, friendly, accommodating and just beautiful."
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"Ok. Not my imagination. I have never felt so uncomfortable. I sat down next to a lady that was so nasty and negative. Dirty looks. I calmly asked her if she had a problem she snorted at me. I laughed and took my ticket and told her welcome to Trumpland Karen. It seems that lately the crowd gas changed at MResort. Not classy anymore. Dirty machines not being cleaned. Cigarettes butts and dirty ashtrays. Empty drink glasses. Is it the politics, the covid? Just uncomfortable and need to not go there anymore. Sad. Lost its shine."
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"Stayed in the M rooms are nice and clean. Came with the family. Some restaurants are closed due to Covid so theirs not a lot of food choices. Kids had a drink and donuts from baby cakes which they were kinda pricey for us. One thing our family wanted to do especially the kids was going to the pool so I called the hotel ahead of time to make sure it was open which they said yes. We got there on Sunday check in, got settle and went to dinner. The next day we all got ready for the pool went downstairs and the pool had a sign that it was CLOSED it was a BIG disappointment especially for the kids it ruined the day for them. The problem is that if I'm calling ahead of time have the right information for your guest so they won't be disappointed."
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"I'm not about to say that M is better than some of the hotels that I've not given 5 stars to. But the overall package provided by the M is tough to beat! Also doesn't hurt that I got some comped rooms, probably because I had a very bad day at the blackjack table earlier this year. :(So yes, although the M is my preferred hotel to gamble, this particular trip was the first time I actually stayed here. My comped room as a two queen room with a Strip view. Really spacious room, amazing view of the Strip, and an even bigger bathroom! Super comfortable for sure. If these rooms were on the Strip, they could easily have charged a premium price.Staff here were really friendly. Super accommodating every time I've been here, either for this particular stay or when I was trying to figure out my rewards for all my gambling.Location is obviously a bit isolated, seeing as how it's a 15 minute drive from the Strip. Which actually suits me these days. As I've shifted away from my partying in Vegas days to eating and gambling in Vegas instead, I'm totally fine being able to drive to the action without being in the action itself. Just make sure you have a car if you decide to stay here.As I've mentioned already, the M is my favorite hotel to gamble in Las Vegas. It's very quiet by Vegas standards, doesn't smell like smoke, and is fairly empty for the most part. Makes it very comfortable to gamble here for hours on end, which I've definitely done on more than one occasion.If you get a chance, definitely come try their buffet, Studio B Buffet. Check my separate review for it, but know that I've never had better prime rib at any other buffet. Super delicious!Like I said, M isn't better than some of the hotels I've stayed at on the Strip and given four-star reviews for. But the overall package of the M is hard to beat, especially for how over the Strip I am. Can't wait for my next stay here!"
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"This place is BEAUTIFUL!!!! I am so happy I booked to stay here. Browsing booking.com and looking for something nice away from the strip I saw this place. I was definitely not ready for what they offered. You literally never would've had to leave the resort. They offered several restaurants,  room service, spas, bars, I mean literally everything on this resort. Free valet too. The room and view was beautiful! I would love to revisit in the summer when we could use the pool & jacuzzi, it was too cool in March for use and it appeared to be closed anyway."
M Resort Spa Casino,Yelp,"We love staying at this resort! We got engaged here and it was perfect! We have stayed here 6 times in the past 4 years, and it has been a pleasant stay every time. There are several restaurants inside the hotel, and the selection is great. The casino stays very clean for a casino and staff are all very friendly. Excellent pool that's so nice and chill that even locals visit! Their gym is very large and full of new equipment. The hotel rooms are very spacious and clean. Excellent loft options available! We love that it's off the Las Vegas strip and more laid back than the strip, but the strip is still close by and only an Uber ride away!"
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"I didn't stay at the hotel, but I did visit some of the shops and the casino. They have more or less the same safety protocols as other major resorts. The lobby/casino area has better decor than most."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"I'm staying at the Wynn for work, and have so far, have had the worst experience ever. I appreciate that it's Covid and am always wearing a mask and being very respectful. That being said, the service is awful here, there are tons of employees standing around but will not help in any way shape or form. I was with some work colleagues at the pool and we asked six different people to get a drink and everyone said ""no I'm not the server"" and pointed to someone else, an hour later finally someone came up and said it was last call and we can't have a drink. This isn't even the worst, this is just one of the many awful experiences I have had at the Wynn. I'm here for six days, Not cheap, do you think they would treat us a little better? Nope! Do not stay here, find any other hotel on the strip do not stay at the wind."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"Great food, nice and friendly folks! And Wow did I say great food! French toast was out of this world, the baked tomato was unbelievable and that's not to mention the blackberry jelly."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"Easily the best hotel. The service, the staff, the decor. Had a great three days here. Fantastic experience with the pool renting a cabana and incredible spa. Excellent all around."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"Over the past 10+ years I've stayed at the Wynn Encore about 6 or 7 times. Always at the Encore, but this is my first time at the Wynn. Both towers are gorgeous. The rooms are clean, well decorated, and spacious. Linens and amenities are top notch. There are several pools to choose from and one beach club. Great selection of restaurants.  Easy parking.  Highly recommend."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"Excited to get back to all the action on Vegas.Why not live it up no enjoy the best the town has to offer!? Received my offer and booked it immediately. I'm literally counting down the days until I set foot at the Wynn.Luxury, opulence and opportunity awaits me..."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"Great place to wine, dine, stay and play.  I try to make it out to Vegas at least once every quarter.  Work hard, play hard.  The staff at the Wynn do things right.  You can't beat the location.  My wife loves the shops as well as the spa.  I can't wait to get back.  Great sized suites and you can't beat free.  You're sure to see a celebrity or two.  My wife and I have seen a few in our last couple trips."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"*Covid Update*Let me start off first by saying going back to Vegas since the pandemic is nerve wrecking, but Wynn has taken all the precautionary measures to make it a little easier.  We arrived mid-week because we didn't want to deal with the crowds during the weekend. We didn't want to come the first week when Wynn re-opened because we weren't sure how it was going to be. Moreover, we knew it would be a tad more crowded.  We also didn't want to go July 4th week/weekend because that time would also be crowded. Thus, we settled on the week in between and it was terrific. From the moment you step a foot inside the hotel, you are greeted by employees with mask coverings taking your body temperature using IR. Thus, it was not stop and go, more like a steady flow. Check in was a breeze, all the stations were open. I did try to ask for a complimentary upgrade and politely tipped for the higher view. (Yes, we pretty much had to pick up everyone on the elevator on the way down but more on that later)The room was a taped at the door to ensure it was sanitized. I do enjoy the room and the view of the golf course because the view on the construction of Resort World is less to be desired. The ice machine by the elevator can be had. I previously read that you had to request it via housekeeping, that is not true now. Speaking of housekeeping, we had a lady who cleaned our room without a mask. We had left some $ and a note asking for slippers and towels. Long story short, she never gave us slippers but I did call housekeeping and they were awesome! Delivered in 15 minutes. The pool is terrific. No reservations required. You'll be asked to scan your room key upon entering. Water is just the right temp. However, it's first come, first served to get a chair. BTW The fake grass is scorching hot. Service at the pool was a little bit of a miss for us. We asked our waitress for a menu and she passed us many times and finally was able to ask her again 45 minutes later. We ordered a drink, some quesadillas, and some fries. I understand pool dining was expensive, but there will be a $5 charge in addition to tax and gratuities that I have yet to figure out which no one explained. As to the room, the TV the channels were clear. The TV is an LG nanocell so glares are minimal. You can find a few Asian channels and some investment channels like CNBC. We do love they have Food Network here but the Travel Channel did not work for our room. You'll get a small tube of hand sanitizer and 2 masks in your room. Oh, and a note about Covid that you already probably know about social distancing and washing your hands. The bed here is comfortable, at lease one of them was. One of our bed sunk towards the middle so we had to sleep towards the edge on that bed. Double beds here are okay, but next time would just rather do a king bed, and perhaps I'll just sleep on the couch. The parking lot has security on bikes patrolling and it felt safe. Not all the spots were taken so goes to show that the hotel wasn't at capacity. BTW, if you park at the main garage off Las Vegas Blvd, entrance to the casino is on level 2. The flower displays by guest registration are very nice, always a pleasure to see Wynn's decorative side.  The casino itself has lots of hand sanitize stations and plexi glass for games like blackjack.  The lobby bathroom is every other urinal, including the wash sink. (At least for the men's). I tried getting a reservation for the buffet the day it was opened but was put on a waitlist. Someone from the hotel was supposed to call me, but that never happened. We just ended up getting some food to-go from neighborhood restaurants.  (Lots of choices off Spring Mountain, a short drive away)So all in all, a great experience to ease back into Vegas. We loved it so much (except for a few misses noted above), we are coming back next month. Just note, note everyone wore a mask while we were there and not everyone follows the 4 people inside the elevator rule (including the workers). But do what's comfortable for you. Be vocal if you do not feel something is right. Someone at the hotel will take care of you."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"Well if your looking for a great hotel/casino with a fantastic view and a great golf course... the Wynn will not disappoint. I believe that this may be one of the best locations to stay at on the strip. They are doing a wonderful job with the covid epidemic. I really think it is top notch and their service is just hard to beat. They clean everything, take temps, clean some more, and have everything sectioned off. As far as a business they are doing everything they can possibly do beside just arresting people if they don't wear a mask, which let's face it will never happen. Great job to the whole team and I would highly recommend that everyone give them a try, especially the tower suites."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"I was more of an Encore girl as they often have good rates on rooms there, it's newer than Wynn, and I liked the natural sunlight coming in through the windows of the their pretty casino.  I decided on the weekend of the Rock and Roll marathon however to try for a Wynn Tower Suites upgrade since I knew their driveway would be open to valet and ride share.  I was able to get the upgrade, and I've been hooked since then.  The driveway leading up to Wynn Tower Suites is super pretty, as is the atrium at the entrance that leads to the hotel.  I was definitely wowed by how nicely decorated the space was for the holiday season and took so many videos and pictures of it.  The front desk was not busy at all, and there were no charges to check in early.  There's a lobby bar next to registration with plenty of seating, and Tableau restaurant (which I really like) is right there too.  There's also a pool just for Tower Suites guests, and the grounds leading to the pool are so pretty.  I had a king room, which was nice, bright, and spacious.  With your stay in that tower you get $50 daily breakfast credit at 6 restaurants to choose from starting the day after you check in, and you get nightly turndown service too.  The bottled water and chocolates we got each day were a nice touch.  I love how it's an easy walk across the street to Palazzo, which I must admit is where all my favorite restaurants are.  My one complaint would be that there's only a power outlet on one side of the king bed, which is totally inconvenient.  Also, on my most recent stay, no staff members at the front door offered to help my sister and me with our luggage or at the very least open the door for us.  I still really like Wynn Tower Suites though and plan to come back - just hope to experience more courtesy on our next stay."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"It's a well appointed hotel. I have been here a few times, but mostly for shows. It's a luxurious in design, then again what newer hotel in Las Vegas in the past 10 + years isn't? I did see Cirque Du Soleil show here once, was a great venue for it. Love the garden feel on the main floor. It's an older hotel by now, but when they opened, it was the it hotel. I even saw Cindy Crawford there once. There's so many great spots for photos in and around the hotel."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"I've been a client of the Wynn since the day they opened. But I've never felt so moved to write a review until I went back after they re-opened following the covid pandemic.Out of all the hotels on the strip, they seemed the most put together in terms of ensuring guest safety, from the infrared scanners at each entrance, to multiple sanitizer stations throughout the property, and all the safety precautions exercised by the staff, from front desk, to restaurant bars, to pool lounges.Now, I will say that not being able to see staff faces had a noticeable impact on the traditional ""welcome feel"" I've always experienced at the Wynn, but the trade-off for guest security was well-intentioned, and well executed. I usually stay in the Tower parlor suites, with an additional 2-bed room attached, and noticed that all room amenities were removed. Everything, from shampoo, toothbrushes, room snacks, and refrigerator beverages were removed. It actually makes perfect sense in order to minimize contagion risk, as well as time it would take to re-clean the room for the next guest. Amenities are furnished to you separately when you check in, and were delivered shortly after I got to my room.I applaud this hotel, and will always remain loyal for putting their guests first."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"No other hotel in Vegas screams of class. Oh they try to imitate, but none exude the level of exclusive chic that is Wynn.From plush flowers.... EVERYWHERE..... to some of the best restaurants (especially Asian..... of all sorts... Southeast Asian, Japanese, Chinese..), and one of the hottest clubs on the Strip, this really is one of the few hotels that has the UC-factor.... you know... ultra-cool... (yes... I know I just made that up.... but seriously.... soooo ultra-cool... soooo UC!!)One of the things I especially love about this is the hotel floor design. The place never seems to reach the level of chaotic frenzy on crazy check-in/out times. Yes there are times when it fills up like any other place, but it always seems to move, and nobody really complains like they do at Paris, MGM, or Bellagio, where the check-in line crashes with the main entrance so it always feels like a zoo... but with more smelly people.While the hotel has a couple of great clubs (XS and Tryst), it doesn't have the feel of 24/7 frenziness that, say, Cosmopolitan has (don't get me wrong, I love the Cosmo too..... but that place is a boner factory).Class and ass. There. I called it. Class and ass."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"When celebrating another milestone in life, I knew that Las Vegas was definitely in the cards for me. In order to get the best experience, there were only two options to chose from: the Wynn and the Encore. These two hotels are THE best hotels on the strip.This time around, I stayed at the Wynn's sister resort, Encore. However, I did spend a good amount of time mingling with people at the Wynn casino.Seeing as this is the beginning of the post-Covid era, there were not too many people around. In fact, there were maybe a dozen people gambling (this count excludes the staff). Although the staff members were all wearing masks, very few guests outside my crew were. This concerned me some, but since my crew were all sporting N95 masks, we were ok.The staff members here were very accommodating. They really go above and beyond to make sure you enjoy your stay. And this is exactly the treatment that I expected from a place like this.Aside from the casino floor, there is a spa, a pool, a gym, and high-end shops. There is a Urth cafe in the middle of the shopping plaza, and I was informed that Wynn guests get complementary Urth coffee in their first morning there. The decor here is amazing. The quality and details are a hallmark of this fine hotel. That, plus the customer service, will keep me coming back here. Hopefully, once the pandemic dies down, I can bring more of my friends here for a good time."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"The Wynn... I love this place! It is one of the higher end hotels on the strip. The people are dressed to the nines here, and I find exactly what I want in this sort of environment.This place has the perfect touch of Vegas luxury, and it will be where I will be hosting my graduation party next summer.In between the Wynn and Encore is Botero steakhouse, which is one of the best I've been to yet.This place is both a good destination and an inspiration."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"This was the first time I've stayed at the Wynn and omg it was amazing, I don't think I will stay anywhere else again. It was classy but modern and the staff is just above quality from the rest of LV. If you stay here you don't need to leave because every Restrant you would like to hit is here and they are on point. I would highly recommend this place."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"Second time we checked in and room key not working , the battery died on our room key and the door did not work so we sat in hall waiting for help for 45 min"
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"Getting worse and worse , this used to be the best customer service but it's going upside down .No employee cares about the customer service and I will never return to this place anymoreEmployees don't care , management Evan worse"
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"Sure, I'm a fan, it's a glorious spectacle of all that Vegas embodies.Wynn was always on my short list of Strip casinos to recommend to visitors. Even though I had to disclose that no casino bars comp drinks for play. Since its inception, Wynn (and then Encore) has maintained a no comps drink policy at ALL casino bars. Nonsensical! Atrocious!For 2020, the policy has changed- drinks at the Wynn sports book bar are now comped. I went to check this out on Jan 2, and it's true! When I asked the bartender what the comp policy was, he said beer and wine, then added mixed drinks. He also told me it's a trial at the sports bar to see if they want to expand to the other gaming bars. I also recently discovered their chocolate martini, obtained on the gaming floor, where drinks ARE comped. If you take away anything from this review, remember the chocolate martini.A great collection of award winning restaurants and lovely grounds make Wynn a must visit.  The pool area is one of the most fabulous in all of Vegas. The large waterfall that you must see blocks the Fashion Show silver outer spacey thing across the street. It also is the setting for ""Lake of Dreams"", a nightly show every 30 minutes from 8 to 12:30. It's cool. ""Le Reve"", held in the Le Reve theater, is also a water based show that I highly recommend."
Wynn Las Vegas,Yelp,"Sure, I'm a fan, it's a glorious spectacle of all that Vegas embodies.Wynn was always on my short list of Strip casinos to recommend to visitors. Since you asked, the others are Cosmopolitan and Aria. Still, that lousy ""no comping at the bars for players"" policy!Nonsensical! Atrocious! Boycott worthy! Still, I digress. I recently discovered their chocolate martini, obtained on the gaming floor, begrudgingly. If you take away anything from this review, remember the chocolate martini. A great collection of award winning restaurants and lovely grounds make Wynn a must visit. On my latest trip there, I discovered that gaming was removed from some of the bars. The bartender I asked about this told me more drinks were spilled on the machines than they had players. So limited bars still have gaming. The pool area is one of the most glorious in all of Vegas.
