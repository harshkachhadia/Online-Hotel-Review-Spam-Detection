ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"I went to aria to be somewhere nice to celebrate my birthday and I have to say the hotel was a perfect choice, from the 24 hour gourmet bakery to the dinner I had at catch and my room was clean and was given a great view. I will definitely stay again "
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,This stay was so far underneath what I expected.  The deposit alone is 150.00 a night.  But the value is not there. Staff was not friendly.  Not all but the host suck. If your not playing thousands aday then your no one. 
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"Hard to get a drink while gambling, mandatory $45 a night fee for things you arent going to use. Rooms have noises and leaks. They dont care to ask you upon checkout if there was any issues either, just take your money and run"
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"The room was really cold all four days we was there, we called to get it fixed an it didn’t get fixed, we did even get another room or was we asked.it was really terrible, the room was nice though an I don’t think I will stay there again"
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"The Aria is perfectly located on the strip for visiting other casinos and sites nearby.  Overall, we enjoyed the property.  Food options and slot play were plentiful.  Check-in was a breeze.  We were in a Stay Well Deluxe Room with Strip View on the 24th floor.  The room was comfortable but could definitely use an upgrade, especially the carpet.  Also, many of the countertop areas in the room could have been addressed more closely by housekeeping with a dust rag.  With this said, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay considering the pandemic we are currently experiencing around the country.  "
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"Very enjoyable stay. All staff were extremely nice, friendly and helpful. Rooms were in excellent condition with great views of the Las Vegas Strip. Plenty of slot machines to play. Restaurants were very clean with great tasting food, beverages and snacks."
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,Business trip to Vegas Hoped to enjoy the resort after working with customer - unfortunately the pool and sport area was only open between 9am and 4pm The room was nice but dirty bath Hotel stuff bored and unmotivated  In summery - average experience 
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"Very unsure why this hotel has high ratings. It was extremely basic. The view was good. This hotel is on the strip but its very large,  to get to the strip its a 10 minute up and down walk. If you want to get to the bellagio or caesars its 40 minutes of walking. Food was good but very expensive. You may have to walk bar to bar to get a drink. The hotel is no smoking but people smoke alot of pot and thats all you can smell. At least on our 29th floor. The mini fridge items were about 500% overpriced, I can understand the premium but it was ridiculous. "
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,Thought I would like it but I didn't. Other then great restaurants to eat at I have no plans to ever return to Aria. I believe Aria should train staff to look for solutions to customer problems and empower them to be creative. Aria should train staff to be flexible and focus on making each customers experience great. 
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,Aria was great. With the pandemic and all of these new rules the staff was very nice and informative. I felt completely safe during my whole stay. VIP was great and even talked me into coming back in the spring time for another great experience
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,They don’t even provide guest with complementary water in your room! The casino machine odds are too like the machines are rigged. I would refer no one to this hotel unless you want to Go shopping at over priced designer shops. 
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,Aria gets an A+ in managing CV-19.  Staff were always wiping down and cleaning surfaces.  Gaming tables were also wiped down after a player leaves and when dealers change stations.  It is challenging fighting an invisible enemy but Aria is doing its' part.
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"Aria was a great way to end our Road Trip, we've always wanted to stay there and this time worked. Very clean and friendly staff, the amenities are fantastic and great restaurants. We spent four nights there and 90% of our time on the resort. One doesn't necessarily need to go elsewhere. "
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,The rooms were nice and clean. The Casino was clean and had hand wash stations on the casino floor. The staff was friendly and the rooms were amazing. I highly recommend a stay at Aria. The price was great as well. Great Strip Location. 
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,Very nice hotel for great price during COVID 19 pandemic. Great view abs accessibility. I little trouble when we check in. The first room food on the Tv counter bed was undone. But from desk and courteous get us better room and upgraded for no extra charge
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"Friendly staff, room was run down. Extremely over priced...... $8 for a black coffee at the starbucks on the promenade. very unrealistic pricing. Room had great view but was run down. Broken night stand and safe, dirty chairs, broken bathroom door, broken night table lights. "
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"I have always chosen this property as it seems the luckiest on the strip. However, we noticed slot wins are few and far between as I am sure they have to make their money back. We gambled mainly at New York after we discovered this"
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,Aria was great place to stay.  Rooms were clean.  Staff was extremely nice and thankful to be back at work.  Everyone HAS to experience Shadow Creek!!  My favorite restaurant was Catch.  Great sushi.  Room service was also great!  On time and food was warm.  
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"Nice hotel and staff was very friendly.  Was disappointed in the cost of the blackjack tables with a min of $25 on Sunday and $15 on Monday.  I was looking for at least a $10 min.  At times there were tables empty.  Why not $10 tables?  Room was nice, pool was nice, food is good.  "
ARIA Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"Our bathtub had hair, ironing board had oily/grease stains, lock on door stopped working had to sit outside our room waiting for over 45 minutes for some to come fix when all we wanted to do was go to sleep, tablet stopped working that had room controls on it had to wait for about an hour for a tech to swap it out. "
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"This hotel is perfect for a Vegas visit, but even more if you want to escape the craziness of the strip.  It's not 'walkable' distance by some standards, but if you're just leisurely walking and taking up time then yes.  If you want to be in the mix and middle of all the action stay elsewhere.  However, I walked around a lot of different hotels on the strip and none compared.  If I returned to Vegas, I'd gladly do whatever I needed to do and retrieve to the FS.    The hotel entrance is next to Mandalay Bay and I didn't know the setup before I got there... so the FS is on the top 5 floors of the Mandalay Bay building/tower.  The entrance, parking, lobby etc are separate and unless you go to a specific level you can't reach Mandalay Bay or interact with the guests of that hotel.  But the FS guests do have access to that hotel.    The service is top notch! every single person we encountered from the front desk and door staff, as well as the attendants by the pool referred to us by name Mr. and Mrs., always friendly and asking if they could help with anything.  That is the type of service one would expect at any hotel, but especially this one.  The grounds are immaculate.  The courtyard outside the lobby was beautiful decorated and perfect for a night under the stars.  The pool was very relaxing and enjoyable, the service and food were also great there.   I didn't see any restaurants open but they do offer room service.  The choices are a bit limited but it helps to have it and not be forced to go out.  The food was good, not great and again, it's fine if someone just wants to stay in.  I don't think this hotel has a casino either, but I was glad.   Access to the Mandalay Bay casino is available should one wish.  The bed is super comfortable, the room we had was tastefully decorated and the view was amazing.    If you are looking for luxury, great service and peaceful surroundings in the chaos of Vegas then this is the place.  I absolutely recommend it and would stay there again without question.…"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,We were traveling with young kids and the four seasons went out of their way to make out kids feel at home. When we arrived there were small small gifts in the guest room that distracted the kids and made them feel at home. In the restaurants the staff had patience and treated the kids as kids. They could really just be kids. And this made our stay really easy. 
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"My husband and I had been to Utah, and decided to stop in Vegas on our way home. We have never stayed here, and wanted to try a quiet, non casino hotel. What can I say , it is gorgeous .  Started off with the Bellman /Valet Capt. Kirk, and Gaminj!  Attentive and so nice . Excellent staff all the way around . Temps taken upon arrival which I appreciate . Everyone , and I mean everyone went above and beyond with service. Our suite was luxurious, quiet, and so clean . Beds amazing ! Bathroom gorgeous ! Such a top notch hotel. My husband and I travel all over the world, and this hotel is on the top of our list ! Thanks for a great stay !"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas was a wonderful haven in busy Las Vegas. We chose this hotel because we wanted a non-casino and non-smoking hotel. It is attached to the Mandalay Bay, but you'd never know. It even has it's own separate entrance. Because it sits on top of the Mandalay Bay, you do have easy access to the Mandalay Bay casino and additional dining options. We used this a few times and it was very convenient. The hotel was close enough to the strip to enjoy all the fun, but our favorite part was coming back and enjoying our quiet and comfortable room. We stayed for 3 days in a Strip View King  and we were surprised at how spacious and comfortable it was. The bathroom was also very large. The beds, linens and pillows were very comfortable as well. Customer service is always number one at a Four Seasons Hotel, but it always amazes me how they go above and beyond. The staff was absolutely incredible and we had great interactions with everyone we came in contact with! They even sent us a special anniversary treat to enjoy when hearing that we were there to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. We utilized valet parking, room service and even enjoyed relaxing massages at the spa. Because of COVID, the hotel took great measures to make sure we were safe. All staff and guests wore masks, they took daily temperature readings at the hotel and even provided personal sanitation wipes/gel and masks. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Las Vegas!…"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Took the grandkids for a quick fall break.     The staff went above and beyond to make my grandkids welcome.  Play tent set up in our room was a great surprise.  The staff gave teddy bears and even wrote their names on the bathtub.  Childrens robes And child toiletries were ready and waiting when we arrived.  The pool area is beautiful and serene.   Water was heated just right.  Pool attendant graciously set up our lounge chairs every day and provided endless towels for the kidos who were in out of the pool.  Treats were even passed out at the pool.  FYI Four  Seasons hotel guests have privileges at all the Mandalay Bay pools.  Food at Veranda was great.  It is open from 6am to 3pm.  Press is serving dinner out on the patio and in the lobby.  My family very much enjoyed eating dinner outside on the beautiful patio and then having dessert by fire pit. Another pulse is it is all non-smoking.  Also no gaming but if you want to gamble Mandalay Bay casino is easily accessible. They still have valet parking which made my stay that much easier. The staff and the service can not be beat.  The Las Vegas Four Seasons is a beautiful hotel.  I very much enjoyed my stay there and felt rested after my stay.  Where else in Vegas can you say that. PS - You must see the poodle made from crayons.…
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"This wasn't my first stay at The Four Seasons in Las Vegas, we have probably stayed a half dozen times. We checked in the day after the property opened, 9/26.  Every single moment was pure perfection. The bellman, the door greeter that took our temp and asked the standard COVID questions, the front desk associate and the GM. Everyone of those greeted us with appreciation and excitement.   I took my teenage daughter and my BFF brought her two children. We needed a vacation badly and the FS Vegas did not disappoint.   Our room was perfect, a strip view studio suite. Spacious, clean, well appointed and comfortable. The FS beds are like no other. If you haven't ever experienced one of these, you must. Pure luxury.   We spent our days poolside and were pampered by our usual pool…"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Four Seasons made my first trip to Las Vegas fabulous!  From the moment we arrived to the moment we had to leave, we felt like truly special guests.  The staff is second to none - The Manager - Ilsa, Concierge - Marama, the fantastic Pool Staff - Zlata and others went above and beyond to offer every accommodation possible before we even needed to ask.  The gorgeous hotel is sparkling clean and the Covid precautions were very well implemented while not overly invasive.  We loved the tranquility of the beautiful pool (and the 'breakfast in bed' trays!) each morning and the peaceful reprieve after touring each day.  I cannot say enough about this outstanding Hotel.  We HIGHLY recommend Four Seasons Las Vegas!"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"My wife and I had the pleasure of staying here on reopening night as well as the next day.  We actually weren't supposed to stay here, as we originally booked a Panoramic Penthouse at Delano.  However, they overbooked and tried to ""upgrade"" us to a larger yet inferior suite.  We cancelled that stay, walked through Mandalay Bay and decided to stay with Four Seasons instead.  That was a wise choice.    The experience at Four Seasons was like night and day compared to Delano.  FS staff were all extremely polite, helpful and kind.  You could tell they all loved being back to work and helping guests again.  Thanks to the great check in staff we were able to secure a Sunrise Sunset Suite at a fair price.  This suite features views of The Strip, the stadium, and the…"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Being that this is my favorite hotel in Las Vegas I had to come visit opening weekend. It did not disappoint.  They take all safety precautions from taking your temperature upon check in  to sanitizing pool lounges.  It was wonderful to see all the staff is back. I enjoyed being pampered in my quite oasis.  5 Stars!
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I stay here because the Four Seasons has no casino which will inherently be cleaner, more peaceful and less tourists.   Wherever in the world, the Four Seasons has great reliable service. The rooms are spacious and modern. They think of everything. Dining options are not bad and the amenities are perfect. I stay here every time."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Lovely hotel. Stayed just two nights. Staff was gracious enough to upgrade us. Had a lovely stay. The suites are the very definition of luxury. While some would actually like this, but to us, it would have been better if it was not a part of the Mandalay Bay. The only thing to watch out for is that finding the parking is not the easiest if you are driving. But all-in-all, stupendous."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I’ve stayed at many Four Seasons locations across the world and this one is fantastic.  Rooms are very updated and clean, you have a few options for food and beverage, and the pool service is great.  I highly suggest the steakhouse inside the hotel as well as the breakfast place.  Caution - buffet is fantastic when they run it.  Finally, they have a great place to have drinks at in the lobby."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"It's long overdue for a review of one of my favorite places anywhere, the Four Seasons Las Vegas. We were there just before the national shutdown started, and like always, were treated like royalty. We've been coming on business for a number of years, and it's such a treat to be greeted by name and have your favorite martini at check in!  From the rooms to the Impeccable service, the standard for which all hotels should aspire!"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"This Hotel was wicked!!! The rooms are very clean, There are great water pressure in the shower and a giant flatscreen TV. It comes with a small minibar and glass cups. They have many great restaurant."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We stayed here over Christmas (2019) and chose the property because it’s the only none Casino hotel. In reality it’s on the same site as the Mandalay Bay, but the moment you enter the FS, you are in a sanctuary away from it all. We had one of their one bedroom suits which was fabulously spacious with the most gorgeous bathroom. As typical for FS, the bed was super comfortable and the service great all around. I’ve been to Vegas multiple times and I would now only want to stay at the FS. It’s great value too! "
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Came here with some buddies on a weekend trip to LV. Everything about the hotel was great. Standard luxury.  I knock off one star because the restaurant wasn’t great. Overpriced for the food quality you get, and the proportion sizes are unnecessarily large. I’m a pretty big guy, too, and I was feeling stuffed just after my appetizer.  Hotel’s fine, but avoid the restaurant."
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Our family of four (children ages 13 and 10), stayed at the Four Seasons for our Spring Break trip last week! While I've been to Vegas many times, this was my first time at Four Seasons. We chose the hotel at the recommendation of our travel agent so our children would not have to enter a casino to get to the rooms! It was the PERFECT place for us to stay - quiet and peaceful! We had two adjoining rooms and loved that setup! Also, did I mention the service? Just what you'd expect from Four Seasons. My name was used the entire time I was there! And, upon check-in, the manager came to greet us. I told her our flight was delayed and I was worried we weren't going to make our dinner reservation. She immediately said, ""I'll have our concierge call right now and have that reservation…"
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,So if you are looking for a laid back casino/hotel that isn't as busy as they other resorts then this is your place. It is modern enough with all of the luxuries that you aren't missing anything. It just doesn't have a fancy catch theme. I personally think there are better casinos to gamble in. But overall nice quiet place to stay.
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"What an experience!  World class service, super clean rooms and a great nights sleep. When you look at the nightly rate it seems pricey but when you stay there you get to experience what the “royal treatment “ feels like. Worth every penny and we will definitely stay there again. "
Four Seasons Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"With so many of the major hotels in Vegas full to bursting with tourists and gamblers, The Four Seasons was a peaceful escape. Stunning views of the Strip from our 35th floor suite and a huge amazingly comfortable bed gave us the perfect base to recharge and keep our long days on track."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"The SKYLOFTS is the only place in Las Vegas I have experienced 5 star service. While celebrating our 10th anniversary, Joe and his team went above and beyond to make our entire experience wonderful. The SKYLOFTS does not feel like a part of the MGM. Absolute luxury. "
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"First things first- I’d like to say,   WOW. JUST WOW.   The MGM Skylofts...is just WOW.  I have had the pleasure of staying at some of the best hotels in the world, and I can say without any hesitation, that the MGM Skylofts sets the bar. From the instant that you step onto the property- to the second you leave, you feel like a real King/Queen.  I am greeted by a concierge, a bellman, and the head valet (Roger 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼) when I arrived at the skylofts... They truly know what the epitome of a “grand entrance” is. I was whisked straight to my suite upstairs by Roger and the concierge... and they must have rehearsed this-because it was literally 12am when I arrived and I was in show- how flawless everything/everyone was. Every single staff member I encountered was warm and professional, throughout my stay. You will think that they paid me for this review, but let me assure you- I am writing this review based solely on the service I received.   I’m generally a little hard to please, but the skylofts left nothing to be desired. I was astounded (in a good way) at the etiquette and professionalism of every single staff member I encountered... To me, etiquette sets the PROS from the pros...the 6, maybe even 7 star hotels, from the 5 star hotels. Every time I stepped out of the elevator I was greeted, usually by name, by whom ever was at the front desk upstairs... I can’t explain how pleasant it was to walk into the “zen” skylofts lobby and furthermore be greeted so warmly by the concierge.   I also had the pleasure of meeting two of the managers, Savannah and Anna. Again, it’s hard for me to put into words how extraordinary these two individuals are. I met Savannah during my first stay back at the skylofts (last time being in 2014) and she was so professional and discreet that I didn’t know she was the manager when I met her. I’ve met a number of esteemed front office executives in my travels...but I could have never told that she was the “head honcho” from my brief, first interaction with her. And when I found out who she was, I felt a little dumb- but more so pleasantly surprised at how down to earth she was. And ever since then, she has extended the most extraordinary service that I’ve ever received...from ANY hotel/resort I’ve ever stayed at. There are one or two hotels in the world that I could possibly put into the same category, but Savannah- in my opinion, represents the pinnacle of 5 star service.   I’ll add that I’m a gambler- not a whale, but I gamble... and I usually am able to get “transportation,” and I’d like to say that MGM Resorts truly knows how to take care of their customers in that respect as well. Joseph, Angel, Anthony, Gary, Charles, John, Tina, and Mipch, .. and then Katerina and Jeremy that answer the phones! Everyone is so professional and kind.   And I also want to add that the 24/7 room service (even during Covid) at the skylofts is from the Mansion chef... and if you’re not familiar, the Mansion chef is THE CHEF. I stayed at the aria sky suites a few weeks ago and there was no room service whatsoever, so the fact that the skylofts has a 24/7 TRUE first class chef- which they’ve always had, really sets this place apart.   I’d like to emphasize that everyone at the skylofts is extraordinary. Everyone. And while I have yet to meet Ms. Mulaj, who is the director of the skylofts, I would just like to commend her in setting the bar for 6-7 star hospitality.   The Skylofts is a hotel that is incomparable to even my favorite hotel chain- Peninsula Hotels.   Thank you all, again, for the greatest experiences I’ve ever had at any hotel in my life!!!   Cheers to the butlers, the concierges, the drivers, the bellmen, the valets, the housekeeping staff, the butler coordinators, the managers, and everyone else!!! It’s ALWAYS SUCH A PLEASURE. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, AGAIN. 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼  And last, BUT NOT LEAST! Thank you to my casino host *Ms. Michel Dunkin*... She has always gone so far above and beyond for me and made every one of my stays so memorable. If you need a host and you are a gambler, talk to her. If she can help you, she will!!! Thanks again, Michel!…"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"I decided to splash out on a Sky Loft to celebrate a special occasion and the accommodations at MGM Grand certainly offer a high-end experience - a huge suite for myself and two friends, a transfer from the airport, our concierge met us at the car to escort us to the loft, they even surprised me with a birthday cake.  Our concierge made any tour reservations in advance that we required, although we were unfortunate in not being allocated the view that we requested. Every problem we encountered, they fixed - eg. sending a maintenance man as soon as I reported there were issues with the airconditioning, and he fixed it immediately, we did not have to wait. If a luxury suite is what you're after for your Vegas experience, this will meet your expectations."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,We stayed in the MGM in Las Vegas and the room we had was clean and big and was very modern and  the staff was fantastic they can’t do enough for you me and my husband have been to Las Vegas loads of times but we like to stay in a different hotel every time I would stay here again.
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"This has really gone down hill. HVAC problems, delay getting checked in, multiple room service orders incorrect, dates electronics, unclean casino, etc. why pay $1000+ a night when you won’t experience any of this at the Wynn?"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"It was really impressive. You’re treated like royalty from the get go. Our one BR loft was incredible - and everything wireless WORKED perfectly. B&O AV with Bluetooth, remote lighting programs, drapes - very well done. We arrived at 1030 pm at had a drawn bath awaiting us with champagne and strawberries. You get what you pay for. Kudos to MGM Skylofts concierge team, and Jesus in particular."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"THE SKYLOFT AT MGM GRAND HOTEL is one of the most impressive things I had in my life... They give you to fill that you are the kong of the world The service, the lounge, the limo, the private butler that there for you 24/7 and of course the room all these let you to fill legendery So, for sure my next time in Vegas will be at  SKYLOFT AT MGM GRAND"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,This was the best experience I have ever had in any Hotel in the world. From the staff to the luxury and comfort it was all top notch. We will all definitely stay in the beautiful Skylofts at MGM Grand again.
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"We have stayed at Skylofts before and just love the level of service and rooms here. We were in town over a huge rodeo occuring onsite and even in the complete chaos of that, felt noticed and welcome at every turn."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"Amazing experience from check-in to check-out.  Staff is attentive to your every need.  My friends and I had a running joke ... anytime we wanted or needed anything, just call zero.  The rooms are incredible, the staff is amazing."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"Great experience, staff very attentive, polite, rooms were very clean.  In room drinks were abit expensive but given since your paying for convenience and not value.  Overall, worth the experience. Will do agsin"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,The Skyloft is very exclusive and there are many hidden perks. The butler and concierge service is top notch. They are very attentive and will be sure you have anything you need. You can have in suite dinners ( even from NONMGM restaurants) and they will obtain limo car service your nonMGM plans. We glammed up our stay by having Vegas Formal nights as well as experienced the exclusive Skyloft offerings. I will refrain from mentioning them-- seek out these surprises for a more elevated trip. I will return!
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"They changed policies on amenities. Poor attempts to accommodate requests.  Just a ""no"" without asking anyone.  They charge for water and drinks, which used to be free in a $1,500 per night suite.  My October visit, I waited until 5 to get into my room, when I needed a 1pm checkout this past week in December, I was told anything past 12:30 would cost me $750.  I spend money there for over 12 years because of the amenities and service, yet the new policies seem to eliminate the actual ""things"" that made the lofts special.  I love the lofts, but based on the cost of the rooms, the amount I spend on food when there (over $2,500) and the gaming play as a platinum member, I can't really say I look forward to another visit.  I was let down and disappointed.  The only possible remedy…"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"Skylofts is a very special place.  I have stayed at Encore Penthouse apartments, Aria Skysuites, Bellagio Penthouse, and even the Bellagio  Presidential Suite which were all great, but the staff at Skylofts is the absolute best I have ever experienced.  You get what you pay for and Skysuites is worth the premium.  As others have said, be sure to get breakfast at Mansions Dining.  It was $465 for 8 people for breakfast, but you only live once.  I will definitely stay at Skylofts again.  If you're on the fence about booking Skylofts, Just Do It and you won't regret it."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"The service here is amazing, I had a headache and the butler literally had tylenol in my hands within 5 minutes. The bed was so comfortable the PILLOWS were awesome I wanted some to take home. Everyone was so accommodating we will be back soon. "
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"If you want a luxury experience, please stay at the Skylofts at MGM. What an incredible experience, from the time I left the airport, until I returned to the airport, they were always checking on me and asking what they could do to make our stay better, very patient and helpful staff. The room was over the top, even for Las Vegas, but the staff made this stay great, even escorting us to lunch one day to make sure we didn't get lost. Fantastic service by the entire staff, especially our butler who was always available when we needed him. This was the best stay in Las Vegas ever. "
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"Exceptional way to make your stay in Las Vegas memorable. If you want to make a once in a lifetime trip, then stay at skylofts, however a word of caution-you will come back as this is the standard to which old lady Vegas is known for"
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"If you are looking for the best room in Vegas, the Skyloft Suite at the MGM Grand is the best. You get a terrace that overlooks Las Vegas, with awesome views, and at night, with everything all lit up, it's simply beautiful. The Skyloft itself is on 2 floors, and plenty of room for everyone. If you are going to Vegas to stay in first-class, then the Skylofts at the MGM Grand is the place to be."
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"How from 1 visit to the next things change, I'm assuming their new policy went into effect as of October 1st this year. The skyloft meant you paid the nightly rate and everything was included, you now pay the same nightly rate but everything is extra. Yes, they charge for the water now..next will be the coffee and the tea. At least if everything functioned properly it would be so back..but Wifi was iffy, control panels not working properly..I gave up trying to shutdown the TV in the bathroom. Is the MGM going to start charging to take their trams in the future. Stay tuned.. "
Skylofts at MGM Grand,TripAdvisor,"Our go to for years has been the Belagio, however we've stayed in many different suites at different resorts over the years - this was our first time opting to stay at MGM Grand.  The experience was second to none.  The Skyloft package along with the ammenities provided through our AX Fine Hotels & Resorts booking made this an amazing experience we will cherise for years to come."
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Check in was EXTREMELY SLOW.  The whole line was frustrated. Long lines to get up to the room due to slow ""elevator police"". We attempted to eat at in-hotel restaurants, but.... we went to the restaurant, were told we had to ""check in"" at the main desk, walked all the way to the ""main desk"", waited the the ridiculous line, where then told we had to check in at the concierge desk, so went to that line, waited, only to be told we didn't need reservations..... so, we deiced to leave and spend our money outside of the property....... idiots everywhere at Wynn/Encore."
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,I love the Encore Wynn since my Win in a Willie Wonka for over 200k on penny machine 3/11/16 this has been my FAV place of ALL times! I will always come back here! They know how to treat a guest for sure!
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The Wynn and Encore have done a great job at maintaining the excellent service you would expect at this world class resort while enforcing great social distancing and safety measures. The resort was beautiful, the rooms were pristine, the staff was friendly and helpful and the food was superb. "
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Beautiful attention to detail in every aspect of the hotel. The rooms were big and well appointed. Layers upon layers of details from the ceiling, carpet, walls throughout. Central location with great views of the strip."
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Favorite property in Vegas! The attention to detail will blow you away. Great casinos and employees! Will always be our first choice of where to stay! Choices in restaurants is fantastic. Pools are so lovely! 
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I cannot say enough about how well ran this organization is.  From security, to maintenance, to the servers in the restaurants everything is just top notch.  We felt extra safe in the hotel due to increased security measures.  I cannot stress how clean this hotel is!   I would definitely stay here again.  "
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The best stay i have ever had while in Las Vegas, much better then Ceasers palace, Aria and many other hotels i have stayed and just a bit better then Bellagio. You are treated very well, the hotel is very clean, the staff is welcoming and have you feel as if you are welcomed unlike ceasers palace that made me feel like I was not. The rooms are very spacious and have everything you need on a vacation or business trip. I recommend everyone to stay once while in Las Vegas."
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Horrible experience was my first time and my last while using the restroom I received a text about a family emergency... I started crying in the bathroom and the security guards were called they pushed my fiancé telling her to make me stop crying!!! I’m still upset right now worst experience of my life!!!
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Hotel and casino were both awesome!  Rooms have remote lights and curtains.  Everything was very clean.  Pool was great.  Breakfast at the Terrace Cafe is a great way to start off the day.  It is the nicest hotel ans casino I have stayed at in vegas yet!
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,We have been to the Wynn before and stayed at the Encore tower suites this time. All I can say is everythibg was perfect. The service top notch and truly 5 star. Will never stay anywhere else when in Vegas!! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We stayed at the Encore as an end to a trip to the a Grand Canyon. Glad we did. Room was great, casino fun , food delicious. The philly cheese steak at Charleys Bar and grill was the best I ever had. The food at Lake side was great. The employees all were friendly, helpful and kind in our new Covid world. The hotel has gone out of the way to do all things right. I appreciate them all. Good job Steve Wynn. Pool area was a treat. A great trip had by us thanks to the Encore. If going to Vegas just stop looking where to stay and stay here. You will be glad, we sure were."
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Encore looks newer inside than most hotels in Vegas.  This is my 2nd stay here and I enjoyed both times.  The room is spacious, clean and modern.  I also like the shopping inside the complex.  You never have to leave the premises.  Nice place to stay!"
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Stayed here and we were upgraded to a larger panoramic view suite. It’s attached to the actual Wynn hotel so it’s basically two hotels in one. Everything was great. Room service was fantastic. Food was delicious. Casino was clean and not too crowded. Everybody wears masks and they’re very strict on hand sanitizer and making sure you are wearing your mask. Security is amazing. Highly recommended. We had a fabulous time.  Will absolutely be back. My only complaint would be that housekeeping did come in after just knocking and not giving us a chance to respond. They did this on two occasions. Kind of our fault for not putting the do not disturb button on.
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,I booked a room at Encore via an airline which had several promotions attached to it.  Unfortunately the hotel did not honor all of the promotions although I was clearly eligible for them.  The Cafe (their 24 hour restaurant) served us stale pastries on multiple occasions which was sort of annoying for such a high end resort. Additionally the last night I was there my neighbors were VERY noisy.  I called down to the front desk and about an hour later it quieted down but was not impressed with their response in regards to the issue. That being said almost everything else about the hotel was great and the room was awesome.   I was also impressed by their Covid precautions.  However due to the variety of issues mentioned above I would probably not stay here again and would go back…
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"While Encore has always been a family favourite, this time the service was very disappointing.  We went to celebrate a very special bday for my daughter. While I had mentioned it multiple times while reserving the hotel did absolutely nothing to make her feel special. Not even a call to wish her!   Just didn’t expect this of a hotel of this caliber. "
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We were looking for a mini getaway, despite the pandemic that was occurring. We figured that this is the best time to go to Vegas since it is less populated. Well, Let me tell you, despite hearing the horror stories of Vegas, My stay at Encore was beyond amazing! There was extra security with a bag check and metal detectors, when walking in to the resort, which I did not mind at all. That extra step gave me a slight piece of mind. Other than that I couldn’t believe the cleanliness and sanitation process throughout the hotel- they were on top of it! The second you leave a gaming table it is wiped down between players, if a player doesn’t jump in too quickly. The lounge chairs at the pools are sprayed down after each guests. The restaurants offer you a little placard to rest your…"
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"COVID precautious are fine, and our Tower Suite room was decent...BUT they've started searching guests with metal detector wands and going through your bags at entrances.  There are also random K-9 security dog patrols on the ground floor areas.  Massive step down in the experience of staying at a supposed luxury hotel.  Crossing the Wynn/Encore off the list and planning for the Bellagio next time.  You generally put up with being searched at dive bars, but not at any decent hotel."
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Arrived on my Birthday.  3 nights at the Encore Tower Suites.  The separate check-in and the ability to valet my vehicle was great considering the current situation due to Covid.  As me and my fiancee checked in we were asked about trip and if there was anything special being celebrated.  I mentioned briefly it was my birthday and my fiancee's first time staying at the Wynn/Encore property.  We were able to get a higher room and strip view by request.  This was appreciated.  In addition we were able to get into our room early which was nice because we both wanted to go visit the pool later.  I have to mention that after we did a little shopping for a few hours and came back to get changed to go to the pool for a bit.  I was plasently surprised by a gift that was left in our room…
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The Wynn and Wynn Encore was a nice get away. The reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the lack of drink service in the casino. While playing a slot machine for several hours,I got 1 drink and this was after I tracked someone down.  The hotel rooms were awesome. We had the most beautiful view. The hotel did a great job with safety measures and cleanliness. Some of the restaurants were a bit expensive for what you got. However, I definitely will go back as the hotel was beautiful. "
Encore At Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,I live in the area.  I booked this hotel to get away.  I went to valet and it was closed except for the tower.  I pull over and called.  She told me to go back on las vegas blvd and go to the front of the hotel and a bell boy would take my luggage.  I could find no way to turn into the front of the hotel.  I ended up in Wynn self park.  There was a sign that said Encore elevator.  I took my luggages out of the car and went there.  I had 2 pieces but they did not have rollers because I was going to use valet.  I get to the elevator after carrying my luggage and it said closed.  I called again and they said to go to encore self park.  I am physically not able of carrying my luggage from self park to check-in.  That is a long distance so I just went home in tears.  A five star…
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Stayed at the Wynn in late October.  I've stayed there a few other times.  I simply found that the service fell short of previous visits, some employees disengaged, the pricing at the restaurants overly high, etc..."
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Great service. Very friendly accommodating staff. Nice very clean rooms. Great location. A very good value. We will definitely stay here again! Had a great time lounging by the pool. Everyone of the staff that we interacted with provided great service!!
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We love the Wynn. Clean, modern resort on the strip. Great accommodations and great service. But this was the first time we stayed at their upscale accommodations, the Tower Suites. I don't think I can ever go back to the ""normal"" rooms!  The Tower Suite experience was fantastic. The lobby and lobby bar were amazing, with some of the best check in experiences we have had. Drinks at the Tower Suites Bar were equally fantastic - craft cocktail quality.   The accommodations themselves were incredible - even though we didn't have the view of the Strip, we didn't need it! The views were still amazing and probably more peaceful and serene than the Strip views. The room size and design is fantastic - plenty of room for two professionals. And the bathroom, tub and shower -- oh my. The bed was amazingly comfortable. All in all, one of the best stays I have had in Las Vegas.  And their health and safety protocols for the COVID pandemic were the best we saw on the strip. Lots of staff clearly cleaning and disinfecting on a regular basis. Fantastic social distancing procedures. Masks required. And the staff well trained to make sure everyone is following the rules. We felt about as safe as we could considering we were in Las Vegas! Really great job.  We did have one problem - when we checked in, the host let us know that they had been experiencing some problems with people having too many guests and loud parties in their room. (Surprising for a higher end location.) And we certainly got to experience that! We were woken up in the wee hours of the morning by what sounded like a large and very loud college party that encompassed multiple rooms on our floor. Loud music that, even from hundreds of feet away, sounded like it was right outside my door. The sound of a dozen college students yelling, slamming doors, and playing drinking games. And so on.  We are not afraid of a party, and I have never had to complain about loud music in my life. Honestly, I enjoy knowing that others are having a good time. But it was pretty jarring getting woken up to this type of problem at this kind of resort. We tossed and turned for about an hour trying to sleep, avoiding phoning in a complaint unless it became unbearable. Finally, after an hour and when our patience had finally worn thin, all the noise suddenly stopped. (I'm sure one of the other guests phoned in a complaint, and security handled the situation.)  I never called to address the issue, so I feel like I have a limited right to complain. But it was simply surprising to deal with this kind of issue at such a wonderful resort. I trust that it was an exception to the rule.  All that being said, it was a minor blip in an otherwise fantastic and memorable  experience. I wouldn't let it stop us from another future stay. And, honestly, I would recommend this location to anyone.  We normally love staying in smaller, swanky boutique hotels for the type of experience that the Wynn pulled off in the Tower Suites. Highly recommend.…"
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Despite concerns, we travelled to Wynn for a quick trip with friends... they did not disappoint.  Felt completely safe and comfortable with all of the procedures in place to ensure guest safety.  We would do the trip again without hesitation."
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,We stayed in the Tower Parlor Suite and was a bit underwhelmed at the room. The layout was not what we had hoped as we’d stayed in a similar resort with an open floor plan.  Bed was not comfortable at all; awkward headboard and bet wasn’t a true King. Television channel offerings weren’t exactly diverse.  Bathroom was exceptionally spacious and clean. 
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We went to the Wynn for the weekend. We booked direct. The Front Desk immediately upgraded our room to a nicer, panoramic room. Usually, I like to stay in the Towers as it is easy to come and go, but this time, we tried the main hotel. We stayed mostly in the room. The room is spacious and luxurious and had a panoramic view of the city. It was Halloween and they had security patrolling on bikes, bomb sniffing dogs and when you entered the hotel, you were scanned with a handheld metal detector and your bag was checked. It felt very safe. We did not go to Casino, but it looked like they implemented safety measures with plexiglass dividers, etc. As the hotel was at 46% capacity, it was not crowded, so it was easy to go in elevator ourselves, walk in the casino, etc. Everything…"
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Great stay. Felt very safe with the measures and details they have put into place for Covid precautions.  Service and staff were excellent.  Rooms luxurious and great view of the golf course. Would definitely stay again!
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We stumbled upon the Wynn on our last visit. My boyfriend is Vegan and their restaurant came up. We ended up gambling and was invited back a few months later. The rooms were amazing and so was the views. Very clean. They have spoiled us so I double we stay anywhere else. The only downside which is common right now is no refrigerator or microwave which is a bit of inconvenience. I ended up wasting alot of food, which was pretty pricey"
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Had an awesome time at the Wynn, was definitely top five of my five star hotel experiences. Costa di Mare lagoon side dinner was impressive especially the server with the Italian accent (reminded me of a Disney movie lol) Classy! My fine dining experience included fish flown in that day and it was interesting overall great experience.  "
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The resort looks stunning and the team are focused on their guests. Cleanliness was high, social distancing was being managed and  the quality of food and beverage were excellent. We woudl return and support the great team at this time. "
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,We were celebrating our anniversary at Wynn Las Vegas and we had a very elegant room after I notified the operator by phone about our celebration she informed me she was upgrading my room from standard to premium so she made our anniversary special. 
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Great hotel and fun casino. Good selection of slots and just a nice place to gamble. Felt safe with the cleanliness considering Covid was a concern. Enjoyed having our breakfast at the restaurant by the huge beautiful pool.
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Take it from me, I live in Las Vegas. Wynn/Encore are the best (differences between them are nominal). By far the most luxurious. Worth trying to book directly through their website as opposed to with a 3rd party, not only are prices competitive but they often offer different features & accomodations than 3rd parties. "
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The rooms are nice and spacious and clean. The staff is friendly. The security check to your rooms are excellent. My husband and and I would leave the hotel to go shop or eat each day that we were there and every time we returned, security checked my husband but didn’t check me nor Caucasian men and I didn’t understand that. But the hotel itself is nice. Vegas is expensive and over rated and I will not be returning. Everything we did in Vegas, we can do that and more on a cruise and still have money to spend on our family."
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Ideally located. Close to everything. Beds very comfy. Convenient closet on floor to get extra pillows etc. I prefer it this way because sometimes it takes a while in other places to get something from staff. The hotel rooms are narrow but are comfortable, clean and everything in great order. It was a great value for travelers to the cit. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The location is ideal. The price - very reasonable"
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Overall, I will visit again to Wynn Las Vegas. The room has modern technologies and family atmosphere. I felt secure and privacy. I liked separate room with toilet and bathroom. I was charged for the liquor items wrongfully but gave me credit later."
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Me any husband celebrated our 1st anniversary. Great experience, however I offered a free upgrade or dinner at one of the restaurants. Other than the stay was great. The rooms where cleaned every day."
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Beautiful hotel, reasonably priced rooms and very clean.  Staff is very friendly, restaurants were excellent, albeit a bit pricey.  This is our second time visiting the Wynn properties and would do so again. "
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,They took very special care of us for the entire stay. The best resort in Vegas. When we arrived dropped off a chocolate structure of the resort to the room. The concierge got us into our favorite restaurant at the last minute. Just a fantastic experience.
Wynn Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Best hospitality!it’s super clean..very classy...!has the best stores for shopping...would stay here every time..food is great..service is phenomenal!the accommodation is perfect...ask and you shall receive!!thank you so much
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,Took the kids to Venetian for a few days. King deluxe suite was beautiful with two levels and a sofa bed for kids. Restaurants amazing. Casino a bit small and tight but not a problem.  Main reason for visiting was taking children to the pool. The pools are beautiful and clean. The “lifeguards” have no tolerance for any behaviors other than sitting in the pool. Keep in mind; our two daughters - 7 and 8 - are very well behaved and just general swimming behavior. They were constantly whistled at and weren’t allowed to swim in certain areas. This was for all kids. Would not come back. 
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,"For the price that I payed I was expecting better stay. No microwave, no fridge, no coffeemaker at the room. No shampoo at the bathroom. No decent view, you can hear neighbors next door watching to and playing music. Constant line to get into the elevator. And so on. Very disappointed "
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,"Clean rooms, helpful staff. Rooms are very far from front desk, did not get help and no cart was accessible for use for luggage. Several water issues; not reaching temp and black water from tub faucet."
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,The Venetian/Palazzo properties are our favorite in Las Vegas. This property is ALWAYS clean and is well staffed. They usually have a K-9 team on duty and that brings comfort in knowing they are keeping us safe.
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,My sister had suggested The Venetian back in September and I decided to come back end of October Everything she explained to me was right. This place is exceptionally clean and doors and counters are being wiped down after every guest and in many places throughout the hotel. The place I was told to check out was grand luxe this spot was amazing! I observed how detailed they present your meal and it all was so delicious from the bread to the chicken& waffles to the salmon everything was above standards. When staying here in October the person I was with was amazed with the entire hotel and the detail of the architecture. We ate at the grand luxe which they said was hands down there favorite place and said the food was just so good.  It’s worth staying here if you like beauty and detail &eating here worth mentioning to the next person I know they will say the same thing.…
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,"With never being to Las Vegas before, we wanted to make sure that we had the best experience EVER!! After researching and reading reviews,we decided that The Venetian was exactly where we wanted to stay. The entrance was so grand, people everywhere cleaning due to covid , the hotel was  impeccable. We were greeted and checked in by Maria, she was very pleasant and welcoming, she upgraded our room with no xtra charge to a beautiful king suite on the 18th floor, it was absolutely perfect view overlooking the pools. The room was  very spacious, a huge bathroom with separate tub and shower double sinks and a separate vanity area to do your hair and make up. We had a king size bed and you walk down a step into a beautiful huge living room area with bar and table.  Pool;   The…"
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,This was my first trip since Covid began and I was a little worried but the attention to detail that the Venetian took to make me feel safe and protected was phenomenal. Their cleaning practices go beyond what I would have even  imagined or hoped for. 
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,I was charged an upgrade fee of $49.00 a night because I didn't want to be on the 3rd floor. I booked this room 2 months prior thru SW Vacations. That made the room cost $225.00 a night. I won't be back 
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,"Stayed here for two nights at the tail end of a trip and left super happy and rested.  the suites are perfect.  2 adults and 2 kids and we were super happy with the space.  Rooms: If you are debating between this and the Bellagio I would stay here.  It's really nice to have spacious rooms.  The Bellagio felt cramped for us in the past.  Wonderful bathroom, bedding and our view was great.    Felt safe with Covid precautions being enforced and seeing lots of cleaning by staff.  Tons of restaurants. Thumbs up for Grimaldis, Yardbird, and Hong Kong cafe.   Casino was fine.    Pool: The venetian and palazzo deck were open.  All hot tubs closed.  Masks to be worn at all times except when you are in the pool. Lots of staff enforcing this when people not observing the rule.    Gym: It's…"
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,"fabulous hotel offering a fabulous experience. check in was very efficient, the rooms are oversized and nicely furnished, and the hotel itself has every shop you can think of. no fridge or coffee maker in the room, but this is standard for hotels on the strip."
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,"My friend and I stayed at The Venetian last week (Mon-Thurs), and had a lovely visit with zero issues.  Check in was smooth.  Our room was not ready yet, so we left our bags with the luggage desk and went to the Grand Lux Café for lunch.  We received a text and went up to our room, and our luggage was delivered within 10 minutes.    After all the reviews I had been reading about crowds and marijuana smoke, I was apprehensive that we had chosen the wrong resort for our Vegas trip, but I was very pleasantly surprised!  Our suite was on the 33rd floor in the Venetian Tower, and was SO CLEAN, I was amazed.  There wasn't even any dust in the farthest corners of the room.  Also, the room was very very quiet.  I'm not sure if we just has good neighbors on our floor, or if the…"
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,"Have stayed at all the top Vegas hotel/resorts and the last few trips to Venetian weren't up to par at all.  Service, gaming, pool...all just so so.  The Restaurants in the hotel I will say are very good."
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,"We had a lot of fun spending time with my family celebrating my birthday at Venetian Hotel, staff were friendly and courteous and safe! Next time I celebrate any occasions Venetian is my choice.  I will definitely go back to Venetian Hotel. "
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,"Outstanding service, Nice clean room in great shape. They provide masks and sanitizer in the rooms and also all over the casino floor . Noticed enforcement of wearing masks over nose and mouth. Would highly recommend the Venetian."
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,"We stayed here on the 28th for 1 night. Our room was not cleaned properly, my 8 year old son found a used vape on the carpet next to his bed. We had to dispose of this ourselves and immediately wash our hands with hot water and soap. This is absolutely disgusting, especially during COVID times. We were also charged twice for ""refreshments"". We opened the refrigerator to put our Gatorade in, and apparently this triggered 2 charges to our bill which were 16 and 48 dollars. I can't even resolve this until Monday since their customer service line is open only on weekdays from 730 to 330pm. Ridiculous, we will never come back here."
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,All staff members at The Venetian are very polite and professional. The customer service is spectacular. Not to mention the rooms are beautiful. The views are very nice too. The spa is spectacular also. Everything is clean and the atmosphere is very calming and positive.
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,"This is my favorite place to stay. The beds are comfy, the room is spacious, good lighting, lots of mirrors and tv, the hotel is huge so many places to eat and drink. I also enjoy the location of the hotel where it’s close to walk to other places on the strip. "
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,We stayed at the Venetian for a week for our wedding and honeymoon. We stayed in a one bedroom suite. Overall it was a GREAT stay. Every single employee was kind and courteous. The only issue (which really wasn’t an issue for us) was we were unable to valet park. We ordered in suite dining several times and the food was excellent. Our room was beautiful and very clean. The view was amazing! The casino was clean and well maintained. We ate at several restaurants inside the Venetian and were not disappointed. We basically stayed within the resort and had everything we needed. I can’t wait to go back!
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,"It was one of the most memorable moments of my visit. The Venetian Canal and the Gondola right was definitely very memorable. I came here because I had already visited their Venetian Macau Hotel Resort and that was the start of my love for this Venetian Hotel and Resort experiences. Incidentally I also had  the lovely and original experience of Venice. I have been to Venice Italy and stayed at Carlton on the Grand Canal, right opposite the Railway Station. The Venetian Hotel experience is one of the best and finest Holidaying expectations. Venetian Hotels have to be experienced to be believed."
The Venetian Resort,TripAdvisor,Really enjoyed the king suite room very clean and smelled so good highly recommend  also slots and food and drinks where good and parking was good must go back and stay again and longer didn't wanna leave 
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,Came here for my GFs 50th bday. Room and casino is excellent. Parking is free - maybe because of COVID. But WiFi is the worst. We stayed on the 43rd floor but that shouldn’t be an issue. First the network doesn’t appear on roof our iPhones or my Mac laptop despite multiple restarts and resets. We get 2 cosmopolitan WiFi networks but not ResortCosmopolitan which is the one that matters. I even talked with staff twice but nothing helps. Maybe I need to go to the business lounge? But that’s hella inconvenient. Not happy about the WiFi. Photo is view from our balcony.
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"Let me start by acknowledging that there have been some security concerns with this hotel over the last few months.  I was here in July and witnessed rampant dangerous scooter usage, disorderly conduct by patrons and a real problem with marijuana reek. On this trip I saw a lot of evidence that the property has taken action to deal with it.    We stayed in a beautiful wraparound terrace suite with a magnificent view.  TIP:  If you book this room for the Bellagio Fountain view, you need to be on a high floor: 25th or above.  (The lower floors have the Bellagio sign blocking the view.)  On our second night the suite below us seemed to be having a party.  Even though our windows were closed we could here the chanting screams of ""Shots! shots! shots! shots!"" after midnight.  One call to security took care of it and the party quieted down or stopped within 20 minutes.  Big thumbs up.  There is still a lot of pot usage in the hotel.  We could smell it almost every time we went out on the terrace, but the room itself did not smell of it.  I imagine this is a difficult area to address.  Maybe they should designate a floor or two for Pot Smokers?  It is very unpleasant right now for non-smokers.   I only saw one set of scooters coming through the property in the five days I was there.  It was being escorted slowly through the casino floor by security.  Another big thumbs up! In July those scooters were a menace all over the strip.  We ate at the Henry, Wicked Spoon, Holsteins, and Lardo.  Both the food and service were excellent.  I would recommend those restaurants highly.  There was only one downside to our stay.  The casino loyalty program and the Marriott loyalty program do not play nicely together.  Cosmo has very trimmed down benefits for Marriott Platinum members.  I can deal with that.  What I didn't like was having to make a real effort to figure out what would count towards Identity points and what wouldn't if I chose to use my Marriott benefits.  Everybody I interacted with was very helpful, but it really shouldn't be that difficult to choose points in one rewards system or the other.  I've already had to make one phone call to clear things up with  the Identity Club and fear I will have to make another to Marriott.  Sigh.…"
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"We stay at The Cosmopolitan for 7 Nights over the fourth of July on the 2nd day the maid cleaned our room and stole all of my medication. The Cosmopolitan told me that it would be returned and when the couldnt find it, the refused to drug test the maid or do anything to help.  I had to go all over Vegas to get my medication replaced and contact Vegas PD.  Dont stay at this hotel they dont value their guest security."
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"It’s been a while since I posted any reviews, but our stay at the Cosmopolitan last week makes me felt obligated to do this. This is a very new property and everything is to the Marriott’s Autograph standard. Staff are very helpful and friendly. The view from our wrap around terrace suite was amazing. They had had sanitizer and cleaning wipes everywhere. Staff are visibly working hard to keep the property clean and safe during this COVID period. Each tower has a pool, and they are both nice, clean, and spacious. Restaurants and food court are excellent. We walked through other hotels such as Bellagio, Paris, Venitian, etc. we definitely feel this hotel’s service and cleanliness is one notch above. 100% recommend this property and 100% will stay here again."
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"I checked into one of their wraparound balcony suites. It is a nice suite but a few things that really bothered me. 1. Tiny refrigerator in a huge wet bar area. Could have easily put a larger (not necessarily full size) fridge there. They had a dorm fridge that barely fits a few drinks. 2. NO GLASSES in a suite with a huge BAR AREA 3. Nothing to play music on, not even a clock radio? Nothing!! In the entire suite. 4. There is an iPad that “controls everything “ and it was dead when I checked in.   The common areas are nice and the suite is nice but a few glasses, a larger fridge and a $50 Bluetooth speaker would have made it 10X better. Just a few suggestions."
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"Having not been anywhere all year, like so many, I chose to go to Las Vegas for a quick getaway. I wanted a room with a balcony, if there was such a thing in LV, and guess what... there is!! I chose a King Studio Fountain View room.  I requested an 'uppermost floor' as I usually do, and boy did they deliver!  My room overlooking the Belagio fountains on the 69th floor was amazing!  Spacious. A massive bathroom with deep soaking tub, extra large shower with the most amazing shower head (devine!), and ample counter space. A blow dryer is included. Next, the living room with huge television, roomy and comfortable couch, and desk area.  Beyond that is the 'bedroom' separated by a half-wall with its own television.  The king bed was very comfortable, and the pillows were among the…"
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,Great games/slots! So many different ones then other properties offer. Drink service was amazing and never a wait. Very attentive. They were also very much implementing Covid precautions. Restrooms were clean and social distancing between machines. They have lots of games that are old and lots that are new. 
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"Great time.   The employees are really busy cleaning everywhere. Yes they are on you to keep your mask on correctly. GOOD!  They are also wanding people who enter the Cosmo on Fri and Sat nights.    Only hotel guests, identity card members or people with a restaurant reservation are allowed in. Also there is a lot of people complaining about groups of people with scooters taking over. Not here, I watched as the doorman turned away a group of young able bodied drunks all on scooters. I saw someone give a 1 star review over it...... They are keeping alot of the trouble out of the building. PERFECT!     I would think people want to feel safe during their stay and this helps big time.  Gaming floor drink service was great. Ate at the Henry, Lardo, Hattie B, and secret pizza. All…"
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"I usually stay at the mandalay, or Aria, but the cosmopolitan beats them all for style. It doesn't have the best pool, but everything else it wins with. The location is mid-strip the bars are excellent the rooms are really nicely decorated and the restaurants on site are brilliant (STK)"
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,So this is usually one of my favorite hotels ever but I highly suggest not coming here during covid. Everyone is on a power trip to yell at you for anything. Pull you mask up pull it down. Sit down to order a drink or stand up to order a drink. It is absolutely ridiculous!!  Came for our anniversary and wish we would have went somewhere else besides Vegas. Hope they make it through this but we definitely won’t be back for a while. STK Steakhouse on the other hand did a wonderful job of taking care of us😎
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"Wife and I just got back from a weekend at the Cosmo. Picked this place because of the balcony room over looking the Bellagio fountains and 5 star rating.  The room was awesome. The view even better.  The service was great too, no complaints at all.  So what is the problem...  The other guest. This place is bad... really bad.  Right off the bat red flags were raised. The people in front of us checking in paid in cash. Didn’t think that was possible at a hotel.  At night, there is a huge line of people waiting to get in the hotel. Why?  Because you have to be wanded for weapons to get in and only hotel guests can enter... unheard of at any casino hotel... especially a 5 star hotel (do you think the four seasons is wanding people?)  That is horribly unsettling. Then you ask why...…"
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"I stayed at the Cosmopolitan when they reopened from the pandemic and I had a great stay!  First, I want to commend the staff for maintaining the cleanliness, enforcing the mask rules and being so cool about all of it. There’s hand sanitizer everywhere and they have someone at every counter wiping it down between guests. All valet members wear masks and wipe down the steering wheel etc. Whatever your feelings are toward the pandemic, you can appreciate the effort by the Cosmo staff.  The balcony suite was super clean and amazing. Even though it was 115° when we stayed, we couldn’t get enough of the balcony overlooking the fountain. The view was perfect.  Room service was great and the food was mostly very good (stay away from the pizza unless you’re drunk).  There was barely…"
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"We have been staying at the cosmopolitan for the last five years and we stay there three times a year. Sadly, it is a very different place these days. We experienced a fight that broke out by the elevators and in general a rough crowd. Our friends decided to rent a cabana for $850, so we thought it would be fun and rented one next to theirs. It was $1200 total for each after tax and tip. We had people from the pool sitting in our chairs and walking into our cabana helping them self to our drinks and food.  Crazy enough, the police were at the pool dealing with another situation unrelated to ours.  It was a little unsettling.  We understand that times are difficult right now but this is to a whole new level.  This is not the hotel that we have come to love and call home when we…"
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,This was a got to spot for me in Vegas...NO MORE!  What is going on... -Dirty rooms that smell like weed- I had to change rooms / room 1 WEED! room 2 dirty bathroom -Confusing prices and mis information- can you say bait and switch -Poor COVID 19 protocols-management allows house keeping and room service to freely enter and exit guest rooms (while you are in the room).  Other hotels social distance slots and perform temperature checks as you enter the hotel...NOT HERE! -I have nothing good to say about my last stay at this hotel...Feels like there is not good leadership or management in place.
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"We were able to get a great rate online so of course we had to try the Cosmopolitan. Daniella at checkin was completely  amazing and she got us a great deal on a wrap around terrace suite with a Bellagio fountain view. This room was so amazing and spacious. There are 2 full bathrooms along with a living room, separate bedroom and a large bar area. The views are something else. I would so try this again for a special occasion. The casino is small but that makes it nice and the whole hotel is a great visit."
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"We have never stayed at the cosmopolitan before so we wanted to try it out.  First, I have to say Marcy at the front desk is amazing!  Second, if you happen to get Daniella at the front desk that is unfortunate. She gave us the worst hotel experience I’ve had in Vegas. We booked the wraparound suite (which was gorgeous). We first tried to check in with Marcy but had an issue with the primary guest name so she explained how to get it fixed. She also offered to upgrade to the 65th floor, if we wanted to pay extra, and said she would put a hold on a room higher up for us and it would be available when we got back. We said that was great and came back about an hour later, but unfortunately Marcy was on break.  We were sent to Daniella and she was rude from the second we walked up.…"
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"We head to Vegas a couple of time a year (well, prior to this year) and always stayed across the street.  We split the week in to two different (but close) hotels for 2 different experiences.  We head one way the first of the week, then the other direction on the strip for the rest of the week.  Staying in connected hotels was always perfect for us.   We had been advised prior to going that the strip was not as safe as before, and we should not choose our normal mid-range hotels as their lower prices were attracting a rough crowd.   We trust our local contacts, so at the last minute upped our budget (but not really that much more) and split the week between the Bellagio and Cosmopolitan.  We had not stayed in either hotel and they are next door to each other for an easy…"
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"Decided to stay at Cosmo for my bachelorette party. Best decision! My suite was amazing!!! Spacious with an amazing soaking tub and outdoor sitting area with a view of Bellagio fountains. Had dinner at STK and drinks at Chandelier bar. There was a little bit of a line to get into Chandelier bar, but that is because of the restrictions on occupancy. STK was amazing as always. Felt super safe with all of Cosmo's steps to protecting guests.  Overall, amazing staff, great f&b program and immaculate rooms!"
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,"This was my wife's and my 4th time at The Cosmo, and there was definite change in the atmosphere. I'm sure the COVID-19 pandemic had a lot to do with it, but the quality of clientele has seriously gone down hill. In the past there was a high middle to high class crowd that would stay and party there. They knew how to conduct themselves. Now, with the severely reduced hotel cost in Vegas due to the pandemic, a definite shift to a much lower caliber clientele is who The Cosmo is attracting. So much so that the restrooms are getting tagged with gang signs and people are trying to take the scooters up the elevators to their rooms. I will be returning February for my birthday, and I hope that The Cosmo has somewhat returned to their normal clientele."
"The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, Autograph Collection",TripAdvisor,We love staying here!  It is centrally located and we are always upgraded to nice room as we are Titanium status.  We had nice suite and there was an issue that we talked to front desk and they moved us to new suite (similar style) and called to inquire if everything was ok.  It was but they still added a food credit on our bill!    They really are enforcing CDC guidelines and felt safe even though its Vegas filled with a lot of people (hotel wasnt crowded though) and masks are required.  Would return here (and we already are planning a trip back for wife's bday).  We had some initial reservations of going to Vegas during COVID but our experience here recently allayed our initial fears.  Highly recommend!
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"This is a high level review of the Palazzo as a whole.The hotel is clean and most areas away from the casino don't smell of smoke. The rooms are spacious and clean and the amenities are quite nice. Compared to the other strip hotels, the Palazzo is definitely among the top for quality. My room was comp'd and I paid an extra $100+tax per night to upgrade to a large suite so I can't really judge pricing. The total came out to about $500 for three nights including the resort fee which for a large suite I suppose isn't bad. Overall, four stars for the hotel. The casino is a different story. The gaming floor is fairly large with a decent variety of games offered. Too bad the entire area smells heavily of not just smoke but the most rancid gag-reflex inducing cigar stench. I couldn't stand to be on or near the casino for more than ten minutes. I eventually made it to the high limit salon and the decor and more importantly, odor, were much nicer. It's a shame that the high minimums keep everyone out but it's way better of an environment than out in ""general population"". Three stars for the casino. First off, I have to admit I didn't try all the restaurants the Palazzo has to offer but, the two places I ate at were outstanding. Both Grand Lux Cafe and Hong Kong Cafe offer excellent food at relatively reasonable prices. At first glance a short stack of pancakes for $10 sounds outrageous but when you find out the pancakes are huge and come with hot buttermilk syrup $10 is actually quite reasonable. In essence, prices are elevated because it's casino food but you still get what you pay for. In all, the food got four stars. Combined rating is four stars: far more good than bad."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Very pleased with my stay here! Even considering it was Super Bowl Weekend and packed with people it was a very pleasant stay. The Palazzo is a gorgeous upscale hotel conveniently located on The Strip. It is neighbored with The Venetian which is equally beautiful on its own and they both have a fair share of high end shopping options in between.Hotel amenities: Free WiFi with check-in, tidy rooms and bathrooms, security check before elevators for room access. We stayed in a two bedroom but it had the size and ambience of a suite! Awesome overlooking view of the The Strip with remote control access to open and close blinds and curtains mounted on the wall. Comes with your standard bathroom essentials (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion). TIP: Take caution with the refrigerator as there is a sensor which will charge you.Lobby/Gaming area: Large floor full of tables and machines. Smoking is permitted so it can get pretty smokey, I immediately had the urge to shower each time I walked through the lobby. Lobby was nicely organized and had plenty of space for guests to wait their turn to check in. Process was smooth and easy! Our concierge Chris was very funny and friendly and made the process quick and painless for us. Plenty of restaurants and bars all around. There is a Starbucks and JuiceFarm right outside the elevators which is super convenient when you need a quick pick me up after a night out.Overall Impression: 10/10 the entire hotel is easy to navigate and well kept. Easy access to RideShare area just down the elevator and the lines were always quick and organized. Easy to get in and out. Decor was always well put together and has lavish aesthetics. Would definitely come back and stay here again!"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,My brother's 21st birthday we decide to go out there with friends and families we had a great time gambling and staying at the Palazzo  hotel in Las Vegas This  first time I ever stayed at a hotel that's nice I'm very excited to spend time with longtime friends that I haven't seen in years it was good to catch up with themIf you're going to come of a big group of people I highly recommend getting the Penthouse suite  because you'll save a lot more money and have a lot more space just have everyone bring sleeping bags and you'll just be fine
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,We are locals. My husband booked a night for my birthday at the Venetian but they put us over at the Palazzo. Very nice hotel. My beef with the whole thing was the $45 resort fee. Really? When everyone else has cut the resort fee they should've followed suit given We couldn't use most of the facilities but yet they charged us $45 anyway. Not bring any of my out of town Friends and family.
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The property is responsive to the current pandemic. Staff members ensure the outside elevator buttons are wipes down regularly. The escalators are wiped down regularly. Throughout the property, staff members are seen cleaning. Furthermore, I received exceptional customer service  throughout stay. At check in, the clerk Jessica was amazing. She noted that my reservation could have been improved upon and thoroughly reviewed every aspect with me and was able to offer an upgrade. The pool ensured guests wore a mask at all times while not in the water. Service for drinks was a bit slow, it took like 30-45 min for the hostess to return with drink orders. About 5 drinks were ordered every  round and by round 3 were somewhat disappointed. Although the Grand Lux cafe in not owned by the Venetian the food was great and again the customer service was on point. The Yardbird had great food and customer service too. The only issue was that the wait was approximately 60-90 min as both restaurants were not taking reservations. Overall, the Palazzo was great. I enjoyed my birthday weekend!"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Traveling into Las Vegas for the Stiletto Dash and decided to give the Palazzo where it's being held a whirl. First- the Dash- we didn't win but got some amazing swag- and did not break a leg! For our hotel visit. Very positive experience with all the staff and visuals were on point. The view of the strip from our suite was beautiful. The suite was not the best on the strip but it was very clean and nice. The one con was the sheets. I was not expecting kinda rough sheets in a suite room. Other than that the experience was really a great time. I feel just the attitude of the staff is worth coming back for.
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I stayed at the Palazzo for almost a week and I would have to say it was a nice stay. The Palazzo is a four star hotel so I expected pretty high end stuff here. Gaining access to the hotel isn't difficult at all and they have valet asking or self parking. Valet is complementary and self parking is free. They don't have tickets or anything like that to track your car. You enter on Sands Ave.The hotel room itself was nice, I had a standard room and the room was really nicely designed. The bathroom was large with dual sinks and a separate shower and separate tub. Toilet had it's own closet. They offered soap, shampoo, conditioner, and lotion as amenities.The bedroom as nice and open and it comes with a sunken living room. The room had three TVs, one for the living room which was next to the bedroom, one in front of the bed, and a TV in the bathroom.The bedding and towels were rough, basically felt like sand paper to my skin. Maybe someone forgot to add fabric softener. They also offer a pool and a gym. The gym at the Venetian is larger than the Palazzo. The gym is only open from 6 AM to 8 PM. I think the gym closes a little too early. Aside from the Sand Paper bedding and Towels, it was a nice stay."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Beautiful hotel however our bed was awful (hard). Also food and trash lined the hallways and was left to sit and smell for 12 hrs or longer. When i notified the desk of issues i was told i could take a questionnaire to help improve. Also with the change shortage - anything under 99 cents you donate to the hotel because they don't have the change. Not a huge deal but i think it's lame.I will say many hotels on the strip are doing this as well but many do pay you out completely.
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"This review is just for the hotel room. The resort feels very classy overall, and the rooms are ENORMOUS. It really feels like you are getting what you pay for. Our standard room felt luxurious and spacious, no complaints from us. I would definitely come back and stay here again!There are no cons that come to mind from our experience. Every detail felt well thought through, from lobby decorations to various details in the room. The toiletries were nice, and it was great having a huge bathroom and shower as well. There is even a step down living room that is completely separate from the sleeping area (not separated by a wall, but separated by space... lots of space!)I have to give the hotel an extra kudos for letting me stay three hours past checkout. I asked for a special accommodation due to my logistics for the day, and they did not give me a hard time at all. That experience alone would make me come back here."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"One of my new favorites! I would highly advise to do mobile check in prior to getting to the front desk because at times it can get very busy. I did mobile check in and was in and out with check in less than 5 - 10 minutes extremely helpful if you are fast pace or in a rush. I also phone to check out and you are in your way ! Super easy. They have security going to the elevator to the rooms, I feel like this is safer ! The rooms are spacious and I would say 90% clean, here and there needed some attention but whenever you stay at a hotel when is the room going to be 100% clean. All regular amenities like shampoo and soap etc.. however I would like to comment on the gym, it is larger than most hotel gyms and it does get busy but you can definitely second out work outs which is nice that they have enough equipment. I didn't try their spa but I would definitely next time- facials, massage etc. All of the staff was extremely nice to me and working with me for my issue and I truly appreciate the managers and staff being friendly and able to help.  I called concierge a few times and they seem to be little less busy than the front desk and got my questions answered even if they didn't have immediate authorization on a decision. The casino and shopping center is also very clean and has a lot of options, the grand canal shoppes are located through the hotel. I would make sure to take pictures because it feels like your outside with the clouds above you !"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We've been to Vegas a dozen times and NEVER HAVE WE experienced luxury like we have at the palazzo !! This is by far our favorite and going forward the ONLY place we will stay, both for pleasure and business !!! Service   11 of 10 Luxury    10 of 10 Location 10 of 10 Pools       11 of 10 Absolutely loved our trip so much we extended it an extra day. Rooms and amenities are perfect ! Thanks everyone !"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,The stay is worth the money!Prime location in the middle of the Strip near everything.The suite is LARGE! Beds then a step down full living room area where you and your guests won't feel crowded. Beautiful garden tub with a tv in the bathroom so you can relax while you relax I LOVED the level of security they have. You MUST have you room key and scan it by security upon entering the room are each time. Great feature!LOVED Restaurant Row where there were multiple options to fix your appetite. I Recommend the chicken & bbq at Yardbirds and Bobby Vs was delicious if you're in the mood for Italian.Free parking if you need  car.The ONLY draw back is no microwave and the refrigerator has sensored items so you can't use it unless you buy the items inside Great experience!
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,I won the kirin 25:1 I bet $5 but machine didn't pay me. I played baccarat electronic table games. Who wants to play electronic games tracking at your bet.
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I traveled to fabulous Las Vegas for a trade show at the Sands Convention center and decided to stay at the Palazzo so that I'm in close proximity to the expo hall and I am so happy that I decided to go with the Palazzo!The service is fabulous and the rooms are incredible! I walked in and couldn't believe how spacious the suite was (but I guess this is what I should expect for a well known hotel on the strip!)My most favorite part of the room though was the bath, OMG! To be honest I never use the bath in hotel rooms, but this one looked so inviting I couldn't help myself, I used it twice while there!It's nice that the Venetian is right next door which has the canal shoppes and some really great restaurants. If I was to come back to Vegas I would definitely look to spend the night at the Palazzo and highly recommend it to anyone that is looking to have a comfortable stay in Las Vegas!"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I just got back from a three-night stay and figured an updated review couldn't hurt, so here goes:  Palazzo one of the nicest hotels on the strip in the same league as the Venetian (it's sister all-suite property), Wynn/Encore, and Bellagio.  I haven't stayed at the Four Seasons in Las Vegas, but Palazzo compares favorably to other Four Seasons properties I have stayed at.  The standard rooms at Palazzo are roomy junior suites with a step down living area with an L-shaped sofa, coffee table, desk and chair, table and chairs, and a second roughly 50-inch HD flat screen TV.  The bathrooms are quite nice with separate shower and tub, double vanity, etc., all done up in marble.  The beds and bed linens are very nice, but probably a half-click down from Four Seasons in my book.  Dining and high-end shopping options are plentiful,  One standout restaurant is The Yardbird, which serves high-end fried chicken along with various Southern food sides, such as collard greens, Okra, mac and cheese, etc.  I'm a fiend for that kind of food, and the food The Yardbird puts out is some of the best I've ever had.  Pro-tip ***  Make a reservation at least a week in advance if you can.  it's a popular restaurant, the lines and waits to eat there can be long if you don't have a reservation.  One of the best features of Palazzo is its location and parking.  The underground  and free self-parking is a short straight shot from the I-15 via the Spring Mountain exit, which turns into Sands Avenue.  Access from and to the Airport is super easy, also, unlike most strip hotels.  Parking is a breeze, and you don't have a long hike from the underground parking structure to the registration desk.  Check-in was breeze with no waiting, and every staff member we encountered during our stay was unfailingly helpful and pleasant.  They do it right here.  I would be remiss if I didn't mention the mini-bar prices.  For instance, 12oz cans of Diet Coke were $7.00 each as were bottles of water.  Pro-tip ***  Take a short stroll from the hotel doors on the strip to the Walgreens to get stuff like that.  If you're a drinker, bring your own booze from home.  Unlike other items, booze at the Walgreens is priced more than double the price you would pay for the same bottles at home.  What about COVID, Chris?  This where the bummer comes in, but what are you going do?  All hotel staff wore masks, which we are all used to by now.  Guests were likewise required to wear masks at all times except when in their rooms and while seated in a restaurant, even while gambling.  In addition to various other COVID procedures, such as enhanced cleaning with an abundance of staff to do so, the hotel also had high-tech temperature readers all over the property to measure the temperature of guests as they walked by.  This was unobtrusive but a bit Orwellian.  In addition, all of the hotel bars and lounges were closed, and I did not see any cocktail service for players happening.  Would I return under these conditions?  Likely not.  It was nice just to be able to go, but. . . .Cheers!"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The Palazzo is a terrific property I suspect gets overlooked by many visitors.  I've certainly overlooked it for years.  It has a lot going for it, and, at least during my stay, was quite a bargain relative to what other and in many cases lesser strip properties were charging.  Some pros:It's a luxury property in more or less the same league as its sister all-suite property, the Venetian; Wynn/Encore; Bellagio; and Mandalay Bay.  The underground parking is easy to get into and out of and easy to navigate.  It also makes for an easy, off-strip drive to and from the airport.  The rooms/suites are generously sized and well appointed.  I would characterize the standard suites as junior suites.  There is a nice sized sunken living area separated from the sleeping area by the step down and a pony wall, but the only separate room is the bathroom.  My bed was nice, probably not Four Seasons nice, but a definite step up from what I've found in more mid-level strip properties.  I like the northish strip location for a change of pace.  It's on the east side of strip between the Venetian and Wynn/Encore with TI being directly across the street on the west side of the strip.  Tacos El Gordo is walkable from here.There is lots of high end shopping in the attached attached mall, if you need more ways to spend your dough.  The place was well-staffed with a well-trained and friendly staff.  I had a nice time and would not hesitate to stay here again.  No real gripes come to mind, so I won't struggle to come up with any."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"This Vegas hotel has spacious, luxurious rooms that really make coming to Vegas an amazing experience. I have stayed 3 of the last 7 years here as it really is top notch in all aspects. The location and pools really top it off."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We stayed in the Bella Suite and it was magnificent! There was 4 of us and it didn't feel crowded at all. The beds were comfortable and the restroom was large as well.Check in was great, Anthony assisted us and he was friendly, had a sense of humor and throughout the entire process I felt welcomed. It showed he took pride in his work.We will definitely be returning to stay @ The Palazzo!"
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Horrible experience last night. We used to like this hotel, but customer service has become unfit for a 5 stars hotel. The manager was very pricky when asking for compensation for a horrible experience during the night. Some teenagers set off the fire alarm at 1:30 for no reason, and every alarm in the floor went off as if the World was ending for several minutes. I called reception and they didn't know what it was so they told us to evacuate if we felt unsafe. At two in the morning not knowing what to do the alarm stopped. We stayed in the room and try to fall back asleep. A few minutes later again the crazy alarm went off to ""let us know"" that the issue had been resolved. Again, the voice as if the World was ending, extremely loud. Kids awoken, horrible night, over $200 for one night of a 5 stars hotel worst than a nightmare at home. So I politely asked to have another night at the hotel since we couldn't enjoy the one we paid for. I even asked for a Thursday instead of a weekend day. The manager told me that they didn't have the need to compensate since ""it wasn't their fault???"" He offered to pay for a couple coffees and muffin that we got for breakfast...as if we were beggars...We just wanted what we paid for...They've definitely lost a long time AMEX Platinum customer..."
The Palazzo Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"*Not visited during the CORONAVIRUS*EVERY TIME I go to Vegas, I stay at the Palazzo.Stayed here for a birthdays, holidays, and a LOT of times on a overnight suicide mission from LA. Been staying here for over 7 years.When I go to Vegas, it's usually with a minimum of 3 people.Other times I've gone with my ex gfs and my friends with their gfs.Either way, the Palazzo has room to accommodate all size groups.I usually end up staying in the regular suite, as it can easily sleep up to 4-6 people.The room is luxurious, modern, and spacious. The BED knocks me out even if I've been up on a 2 night binge on energy substances.One of the main reasons we go here is- YOU CAN SMOKE.2 ounces in Backwoods and the hallway STILL did not smell.The little living room area that you go down the 2 steps to is PERFECT to gather around on the couches with the table and partake in whatever Vegas activities you may be interested in.PERFECT PARTY ROOM. Trust me. Worth every penny of the $250-$400 (Depending when you go)."
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The Cypress suite was gorgeous, with an amazing fountain view. The location can't be beat. We felt safe at the Bellagio. We didn't venture far from it. Our trip to CVS across the street ""walkway"" led to two African American men trying to hustle a donation to BLM, which I clearly said ""no"" to... then we rushed inside the store to safety. Homeless people and street hustlers everywhere. We recommend going in large groups, or renting a car to check out the sights during the pandemic. Do not go out after dark."
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Everything was just perfect! The hotel was beautiful! Food and Service was excellent! The room was extremely clean. Masks and Hand Sanitizer were provided in the room. The Fall decorations were fantastic! Pool was also gorgeous! Highly recommend this hotel. 5 star
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,The views are amazing if you face the fountain. Seeing Vegas from the inside of a hotel is amazing. Upgraded hotel also which was very nice. The bed was super comfortable and it is located in a great place. 
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Took my wife to Las Vegas for her birthday celebration. After looking at serval different hotels. This one definitely stood out to me. Everything was just perfect 👌🏾 Location,Staff everything. My other let down was it’s wasn’t a mini refrigerator or microwave in the room."
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Spent nearly $180 for a room that doesn’t have a refrigerator for personal items but you can use theirs for an $8 water bottle or $20 beer.  Noise in the hallway from simple conversation voices carried into the room at a surprisingly loud volume. And noice came in through the walls from our neighbors that was also louder than you would expect and loud enough to keep waking us up and not able to sleep well. Disappointed.
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"It’s fundamentally the easiest thing to do, make sure the room is clean, especially the penthouse suite. We have always raved about the suite to friends and family, but this was completely out of character, hopefully they can get their staff back to old standards asap "
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Must not be the newest hotel on the strip but the fine service and friendly staff makes you feel just like you are home being away from home! Love everything about this property, from its location, amenities and fountain’s show to it casino and outlets."
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Hadn’t been able to get away from work for a while, it has been several years since I’ve been to Vegas but I never had experience like this. I stayed at the Bellagio and then quite possibly the time of my life"
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Luxury and clean and sanatized. Beautiful and stylish. Friandly frontdesk and elevator guides. Being part of the rewards prigram allowed exellent room and rates. Enjoy the stay, foods and slots. Wish poker had some 3/6 holdem"
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Took my girlfriend to our first trip together and it was everything I had hoped. The food,shops, casinos specifically the service was top notch. We ended our night with an amazing 15 min helicopter ride of the strip. "
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We went for halloween weekend and we had a blast. Was approached at one point by and aggressive floor person because I had a mask on, but I understand. Told him I was going to get a taxi, he told me to stay against the wall pathway. Not a big deal. Other than that we had a blast!"
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Light bulbs were out, lamps were on the verge of breaking, A/C was poor, bathroom wallpaper was beginning to peel off. The front desk was nice. The employees were extremely nice and checking in and out was fast. Disappointed in the room"
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The Bellagio is an excellent resort! They are taking care of their guests to ensure they are safe and healthy without interfering with the great experience. We had a room on the 18th floor overlooking the fountains. What a great view. Spectacular at night! This is a great location in Las Vegas. Right in the middle of everything. While this resort is great, it will need an upgrade in the future. The room was a great size but the bathroom fixtures are old and the bed could a been better. Overall, a great experience and I highly recommend staying here! "
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,The room sucked tbe air conditioner did not cool down tbe room so me and my wife could not sleep because it was so hot in tbe room and we where charged a extra 200$ for incidentals and nobody informed me before the trip
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Excelente hotel!!! Would definitely recommend it. Can not wait until we stay again!! Staff was very helpful and friendly. The location is great, everything is close by. The room was very clean and housekeeping made sure it stayed clean!!! "
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Room is just a room. Nothing great. Staff does not care one bit about guest.  I wouldn't pay for the room. Food selection right now stinks. No good breakfast options. The one sit down breakfast option is way over priced. 
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Visited Bellagio today (11/6/20).  Somewhat lighter crowd, but to be expected with covid.  Everyone seemed pretty positive and there was a good vibe. Most people considerate with social distancing.  Massive hand washing stations on the casino floor an obvious addition."
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I think a lot of hotels are adding a seal/tape to the outside door as an indication the room has been cleaned. Problem is, my room had leftover trash on the floor, I assume from the previous guest. Suggest guest wipe all surfaces themselves.  The shower is slippery when wet.  I almost slipped a few time. Seems as though Vegas is trying to recover economically, because otherwise there is no reason to charge guest a resort fee along with $12 for a bottle of water, a $50 STORAGE FEE- just store personal items inside the in-room refrigerator. I only picked the hotel because of my own false illusions of luxury.  oh well, Caveat emptor "
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Our recent return to Bellagio was a much needed trip after quarantine!  On arrival, the staff members clearly were happy to have guests returning to the Bellagio after the Covid-19 shutdown.  Food, services, the casino were all excellent!  Great protocols and Bellagio staff politely enforce the ""new normal"" safety rules for our protection.  "
Bellagio Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I assumed the Bellagio would be a luxurious stay, but I was wrong. When I got into my room, I thought it hadn't been renovated in decades. Then, I found out the hotel was established in 1998 (I happened to be staring at the gross floor and saw a ""est 1998"" seal on the floor). I'm pretty sure that my two queen bed room had never been renovated.   This room had so many problems. The sink gargled really loudly at night and was really annoying. The TV wouldn't turn off - the backlight would stay on and, since we stayed during Halloween, reminded us of the Ring. I had to unplug it manually to turn it off.  The internet was really slow, making it difficult for me to work. The toilet paper holder didn't come with the bar, so there was toilet paper stacked on the toilet. Why…"
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,"Excellent accommodations, friendly staff, very clean and excellent food. Sky Suites are amazing. Sky Suites pool was very relaxing and staff was attentive.  We will only stay at Aria when we visit Vegas. "
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,"The suites are beautiful but the sky pools thermostat wasn’t working & no one fixed it so the pool was unbearably cold. The food is snacks, not meals & there are no microwaves to heat up any left overs"
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,Bar staff is extremely rude as well as random staff members. Keep that mask over your entire face or they swarm you like flys. No tact at all when asking you to adjust your masks. Bar staff will not serve you anything unless your sitting down and if you are not they kick you out. 
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,All of the safety precautions and little touches in the Sky Suites and Aria Made for a perfect trip; it’s the little things we really noticed like the PPE gift in the room and all the little service items provided; staff is great and other hotel guests used masks and social distancing; restaurants are amazing
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,We really enjoyed our stay! However on the casino floor it is very difficult to get a drink while playing:(((((.  They have to add some servers. I know these are difficult times but they have had this problem before.
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,The rooms are very clean. The beds and pillows are comfortable. Staff is very friendly and extremely helpful. They really make you feel welcome. Great food choices.I highly recommend Aria it’s a nice place to go.
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,"Wonderful vibe even during covid times, great restaurants and people.  New noodle restaurant and Javier's will provide at least 2 great meals.  Pool hosts and security are super nice and very attentive.  Rooms were great and the whole facility was immaculate."
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,My visit is more to go Gambling this is a very clean property and quiet a good selection of slots a good selection from low betting to high betting there is everything in this casino the suits are one of my favorites in all Las Vegas 
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,"We were delighted to try out the new Din Tai Fung restaurant during its first week of operation at the Aria. Each dish was both unique and delightful. The entire staff was friendly, efficient and attentive. All aspects of our dining experience were well coordinated and delivered flawlessly - we couldn't have guessed that we were there on the second night of operation. We tried to pick just one dish to rave about for this review, but once we started comparing them, we had to admit that ""all of the dishes were our favorites"".  Blossom at Aria has long been at the very top of our list of ""Best Restaurants in Las Vegas""; now Din Tai Fung is on the list as well."
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,The staff is the bomb i have been there twice and both times the staff goes over and beyond to make the customers feel better about what’s going on in the real world which is a good hot mess right now. 
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,Hotel was clean and you could see people cleaning constantly while we were in the casino.  Mask are currently to be worn at all times unless you have a drink in hand.  Having people wear a mask while hanging at the pool I thought was a little silly.  
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,"Stayed in the sky suites, was not what I thought it would be. Multiple issues with the room. Although the staff were all helpful and wonderful!  Very clean. Hand washing stations everywhere. Food was amazing. We ate at Catch and Javiers. Some of the best food I’ve had in a while. "
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,As you would expect its a lovely hotel with good service. I didn't get the room I reserved but they upgraded me to a 2 bedroom suite. One of the air-tubs wasn't working so I called down and a maintenance guy showed up pretty quickly.
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,"Please save your money .i spent 3000 for a dirty room, with some ones nail left behind. Daily cleaning didn’t happen. Robes  Bedsheets provided were dirty And had whole. Room was Beverly dusty. When complaint filed with house keeping. It was ignored. The comped food. That was not completely cook. I ordered breakfast every morning. Eggs runny when I asked for well done . Bacon not cooked. If u leave food wrappers in room, cleaning crew will not clean up"
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,"I traveled with three other people.  We were in the private area of the resort where you need a key to access the elevator.  All restaurants were excellent, as was the staff and accommodations.  We shared a two bedroom, two bath condo which was always well stocked with beverages, snacks, towels, soaps, etc.  The living area, bedrooms and bathrooms were luxurious.  Our room had a wonderful view of the city.  We saw Cher who was awesome and The Beatles Love which was also awesome.  Everywhere we ate, whether it was burgers, pizza, Thai or Beef Wellington, was excellent.  I highly recommend to anyone."
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,"Spent four amazing nights at Aria Sky Suites 52016 to be exact. What an experience this was! I had an amazing view of Las Vegas, living room, dining room, bedroom, 1.5 bathrooms. multiple TVs, bar area, walk in closet etc. All lights, blinds, sheers etc controlled by touch controls and tablets. Perhaps the smartest room I ever stayed in and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Can't wait to return!"
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,Very peaceful and elegant. Nice view. Balconies are long and have furniture. Garden tubs. Lots of places to eat in the building. They have drinks in the refrigerator. Overall the stay here was terrific.
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,"From pickup at the airport via limo to the amazing room, overall experience was great.  However, 26-016 seemed a little older and had some cleanliness issues (stain on carpet and paper garbage in closet.  "
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,"Staff was very accommodating. Penthouse was amazing. Some features in room have trouble/didn’t work, but overall a fantastic stay. Worth the money and will certainly consider returning in the future. ."
ARIA Sky Suites,TripAdvisor,"Just got back from 4 night stay with two Sky Suites.  Bellman was just leaving bags in hallway (OK, maybe COVID thing) but when I asked him to explain the automation devices to my guests in the other room of the two bedroom suite, he seemed put-out and gave them a 60 second explanation.  Lightbulbs burned out.  I wish they had more people wiping down slots.  The BJ tables were fine."
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,We stayed here for three nights . 2 other couples also stayed here. We did the Augustus tower and one of the couples did nobu. I loved my room at the Augustus tower but seeing my friends suite at nobu was awesome. All in all we all liked ceasers as we felt safe. Walking in the strip in some areas esp by billagio and Paris did not feel that safe and wound up staying closer To ceasers. My only complaint is no fridge and the one that is in the trim is stocked with their overpriced stuff and cannot be used for personal use 
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"From the Limo pick-up to the VIP check-in, our stay was as good as it could be during Covid times. Check-in we had Debub assist us and she was excellent. Limited menus at restaurants, but the food was great. The Pools, just beautiful. Rented a Cabana and had the biggest one. Had a ball. Big shout out to Daniel, he made my stay at the Pool everyday better. Always very attentive. All in all if your going to Vegas Caesars is top notch. Suite was beautiful."
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,Awful place. When you get your bill back from this place they charge you $7 for breathing their oxygen. Had to call housekeeping and got charged for the call. I’ve been trying to get ahold of someone to see what cost an additional $550. The gold nugget was better.
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"We arrived at caesars palace to stay in our “classic” room, and the lady at the front desk upsold me to a “fancy room with a nice view” only to find out that the only view was of some A/C units/utility boxes. I tried talking to guest services regarding this and they told me I had to pay extra to get moved even though they promised a room with a nice view. We then decided to just settle with what they gave us only to find out that the bed was broken and slanted down to the right. They still wouldn’t move us. On top of all that, the wifi was absolutely garbage and we couldn’t even watch a single movie using it, and in order to connect more than 2 devices to the wifi cost $15/device even though we spent $60/night for resort fees which covers WiFi.   This was our first time staying here, and definitely our last. The Bellagio is a million times nicer/friendlier than this garbage.…"
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Stayed in a King Suite in the Palace Tower at a great price during these Covid times. Room was awesome. Comfortable bed and incredible walk in shower.  Very quiet. Nice views of the pool area. Caesars is a classic Vegas hotel that has aged well and maintains a good balance between classiness and overindulgence. My only gripe was the check in process. After taking the time to check in online, we arrived at the hotel to find all the express check in kiosks  closed and roped off forcing us to stand in a 30 min queue on a Thursday afternoon to check in. Maybe done to reduce spreading Covid but having someone standing there spraying some hand sanitizer in everyone's hand before using the kiosks would have been much better than making hundreds of people stand around in a queue together in an enclosed non ventilated space for 30 minutes especially with half the folks not wearing their mask correctly hanging below their nose.…"
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,Grace was a very kind person. we loved her! We appreciate all she did for my pregnant wife thank you Grace! We will not forget your kind service and the wonderful attitude you had when you were helping us 
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"October 2020 stayed in the Julius tower 2 queens non smoking.  Room was very clean and had standard room but bathroom was large and shower was wonderful.  This tower dumps you right into the casino, which we liked.  Friendly staff and very clean casino.  We would stay here again."
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,We stayed at the augustus strip view room. The room and bathroom were dirty with suspicious stains in the wall. The parcel center was a chaos and customer service was non existance. To book the pool you had to send a text... how old is that.
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,Safe environment  where everyone masked up and the hotel maintained social distancing throughout the hotel and casino. The service staff were great and the registration desk staff was extremely helpful. 
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Me and el viejo had an amazing stay at Caesars this past weekend!    We did a two night stay and both check in and check out we're easy and simple but that might have been due to the fact that we arrived at 9 am on Friday and paid the extra $70 for early check in and also checked out before 10 am.  In my opinion getting there early and paying the extra money was worth it because when we passed by the check in area after 12 pm it was PACKED, even the express check in/out lines were long.   Our room was cleaned really well and was spacious. A bonus was the hot tub in the bathroom. There were snacks in the room but obviously for an extra charge...$8 for a small can of Pringles? No ma'am I'm good. Our view wasn't the best (hello air conditioner units) but it was no biggie.   My…"
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"I flew from Dallas Tx to spend my birthday in Vegas at Caesars. Requested a smoking room and of course now they let you know they don’t have any. Asked to cancel my reservation and go else where and they said I would still be charged for canceling. So I stayed. Check in was smooth until I got in the room. I got to the room and alerted front desk that my room was not clean. They didn’t care especially while COVID is still strong. No one wantsto get sick if there is proper protocol. Bed had hair and blood in it , tub wasn’t clean , tiles were dirty and mini bar had not yet been restocked. They finally sent someone. She didn’t speak much English,she was smart and rude. I showed her the blood in the bed I had already taken pictures of she rub something on it and said no it’s not…"
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Weekends are just terrible, overcrowding drunk, rude inconsiderate people. The hotel only cares about filling rooms at any cost. This used to be an outstanding resort that has turned into nothing more than a cheap after thought, I will never visit this resort again."
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Right now there are limited restaurants, shops and amenities available. Price was reasonable for the inconvenience. Casino areas was extremely smoky even though crowd was not to capacity. Air filter system made me nervous. Pulled back the covers on my bed and there were small hairs on the sheet. Made me very uncomfortable, I pulled the top sheet over it and slept on top of that one...sigh...I chalked it up to Covid 19. I didnt ask for a change because I didnt want anyone else to enter the room..sigh."
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,The casino was so big that I was afraid to go anywhere on my own for fear of not finding my room again.   COFFEE is $10 per cup and there's no machine provided in the room.  No fridge either.   Those were about the only let downs.  Other than that it was beautiful   People were nice.  I liked Express check in and out.
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor," Great service, beautiful clean room and friendly atmosphere.  Machines well cleaned and spaced out seating, dealers and tables also practicing covid safety. Ate at most of their restaurants! Pronto, Americano Cafe, Mesa, Old Homestead all delicious...fun to get out of my house to eat great food and gamble in a safe environment.  "
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Really enjoyed staying here, the room and service was extremely enjoyable. Every restaurant was on the high side of pricing but i’m sure the quality is why. I mostly went around the strip to eat where the food was more around my price range of like 15-20 dollars a plate. "
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"As magic as Las Vegas, you have everything inside the hotel, restaurants, casino, shopping, OMNIA, but on COVID season it’s a little sad to see very few people everywhere it’s also enjoyable because you will get the best pictures of everything without people. You need to use mask all time and in restaurants until you get your drinks."
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,We arrived very late due to traffic and the line to check in was out the door. Kevin H. was able to check us in and still be cheery and personable. it was refreshing to have someone professional and attentive in spite of how many people he has been working with all night.   he gave us the feeling that we were his main priority and reassured we were taken care of.
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Unless you are a high roller, do NOT stay here. I have had better customer service at a Super 8. I am not joking or exaggerating.  We booked a king smoking. One week after booking, all hotel rooms went non smoking.  No one called to tell us. It was the last place in Vegas allowing smoking rooms in all of Vegas. All because of Covid. Ok fine. But no social distancing in casinos and plenty of smoking there and at the pool. That does not seem logical to me?  Our room is dirty and has no coffee pot at all. They lied and said it was because of Covid. Three of our neighbors have them and at no charge. Every day we beg for more towels.  This all after over one hour wait at the only check in desk now. ((Due to Covid)). They claimed that the computers were “down”.  There is so much more,…"
Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,Five star rating over all on our two days stay. From the day we checked in until we checked out was a very great experience. We have decided we will definitely return for another stay in the near future. 
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"From the moment the taxi drops you off or you park, the staff and ambience and everything that the NoMad has to offer is STELLAR!  I cannot recommend a place more.  It is that kind of bottom to top and back down again experience that is 5 out of 5 and if I could give it an 8 out of 5 I would.  Great meals.  Incredible, elegant rooms, staff beyond compare, with vibrant casino and atmosphere...this is top of the line."
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Nomad is one of those rare hotels that’s so enjoyable - one is tempted not to leave a review in an attempt to keep it a secret.  The interior designer of this hotel is simply brilliant. The dark, cozy lobby and common areas and Parisian inspired room decor creates a incredibly comfortable escape from the bling of the strip. Truly one of the most comfortable hotels I’ve ever visited.  Everything from the real hardwood floors, bathroom tile, base molding, crown molding, solid core doors and even the old fashioned looking wiring on the lamps reminds me of a hotel room in France.  We’ve been here for 4 nights and just extended for another 6 nights as we’ve yet to hear a single noise from a neighbor or slamming door. The sound proofing seems exceptional (or we don’t have any neighbors near us).  The entire hotel and casino is now smoke free. No constant smell of pot!  While many of the MGM properties, including Aria, downgraded their once great sheets, the sheets here are soft and not too light and the fully stuffed down pillows are perfect!!!  The fitness center has ample cardio, high end Hoist weight lifting machines and free weights.  Finally, some of the best dining in all of Vegas is in the building (Eataly, Bavette’s, LaLa Noodle) or a short walk away (Blossom, Javiers, Mastro’s).…"
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,We were able to check in early and had a wonderful experience with Walter at the front desk.  He was so accommodating and we stayed there two nights October 5-7.   The Nomad had just reopened after being closed during the pandemic. We had a room on the 31st floor and it was beautiful and well laid out.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat. It was very challenging to find and especially to check in.  I needed a medical fridge and they acknowledged very quickly.  Eately was open but many of the restaurants were not. Primrose was the only thing available for coffee in the morning.  Not great bang for your buck but it did for the moment.  Non smoking casino and hotel now and we were very excited for that.  Would definitely stay there again.  Housekeeping was very accommodating as well.…
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We stayed for one night in January.  The room was large and it had two bathrooms (1 full and 1 half).  There was a living area and a separate bedroom.  I liked the style and design of the room.  The negative part of the stay was the day of check out.  We received a 4pm checkout through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts.  Starting around 1pm the afternoon of checkout we got a knock on the door from housekeeping asking if we were leaving.  We were taking a nap at the time, so that was extremely frustrating.  I said we had until 4pm to checkout.   Someone came back again around 3pm and I had to say the same thing.  Finally, as we were leaving at 3:55pm we got a call in the room reminding us to check out.  If we have until 4pm to check out, PLEASE do not bother us until 4pm.  That experience ruined what would have been a 5 star stay.  I'm probably being harsh by giving a 1 out of 5, but asking us 3 times to leave before our checkout time is just too much.…"
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Very nice somewhat off the strip property, quiet with a lot of amenities on site, close to travel as well as other casinos where shows and other exciting things are going on, room was clean and comfortable and staff was friendly."
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"My 7th time staying here. I like it so much that maybe it should be kept a secret from the masses. Very private and personal feel to the Hotel. It is the top 4 floors of the Park MGM Property, but has its own entrance, Check-in Lobby etc.  A nice personal note greets you when you get to your room with a couple bottles of premium water. I have received other gifts here as well. Love the private feel and the quietness here. Location is ideal for the South part of the Strip. Easy to get down to MGM Grand, Luxor, Mandalay Bay to the south and a tram from here will take you to Aria, Vdara and Bellagio. Then an easy walk (but long) through Bellagio to Caesars, Paris etc. and the northern part of the Strip. Love it here!"
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Truly a fabulous hotel and casino.  I love the boutique feel and the staff are incredible.  I can't say enough about how accommodating the staff is in each department.  If you go to Eataly, you must stop by the bar and grill by Manzo Restaurant.  J.P. is one of the best bartenders we have come across."
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I stayed at the Nomad Park MGM, as I was organising a conference at the Park MGM for a week in March.     The Nomad suites are located on top of the Park MGM.   They have a separate entrance, check in and lifts to the rooms.  You don’t have to go through the casino to get to your room – which is brilliant.       After a busy day working down in the conference area at the Park MGM, it was great to collapse on one of the most comfy beds I have been in.   The room was clean and cozy.   I love all the art in the room and around the hotel too.  You do have the bath in the bedroom – which I find a little weird but as I understand it is the new thing!    The service at the hotel was fabulous.   One thing to note it is a little dark in the Nomad Hotel, but after a little while you get…"
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The decor is fabulous. You are treated very well from the time you valet. They have a great staff and customer service. When you see Ryan, tell him Maui sent you. You also need to say hello to Tim the security guard. He is a great character and fun to chat with.  I love the coziness of the rooms, and eataly is amazing. Get some wine and cheese and sit in the ""Park"" and people watch, enjoy the water fall, or play a game of chess. The morning time is very quite and a great time to just sit with a cup of coffee. One of my favorites on the strip. "
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Overall The Best Hotel Stay In Vegas The NoMad Is Absolutely Awesome. The Answer To Great Hotel Life, Decor, Relaxation & Fun. From Check In To Checking Out Just A Great And This Is My Preferred Stay...  MellStarr"
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We stayed here 3 nights. I was expecting something more like the 4 Seasons at Mandalay Bay. It’s not.  It has a separate entrance and lobby, and a separate pool that we never checked out because it was February.  And I guess the rooms are bigger and nicer than the rooms below in Park MGM.  But I can’t see any reason to spend the extra money to stay here.  You have the same food, casino and entertainment as Park MGM.  It’s just a brand stuck on high floors, nothing more for the money.  "
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,First I would like to say that I’m in Las Vegas 3-4 times a year. I normally stay at MGM properties. This stay at NoMad was the worse!! Unruly guests in the hallway multiple times a night and when I reported this to security they acted as if they didn’t care. When I reported this to front desk they were actually rude about it. Very disappointed with the unfriendly service I received 
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Friendly and helpful staff with NoMad hotel. I didn't have a room at the main Park MGM hotel but when I arrived I was welcomed and well received for a first time guest, I'm sure they're staffed on-par"
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"This hotel is very relabeled to now.  Reception area is abit dark but kinda cool.  The services is great, slow but very helpful and knowledgeable of Vegas.  The room is very modern, wooden floor and very slick.  Tile bathroom.  The hotel is in Park MGM and on higher floor therefore you will have a great view of the strip or the pool/garden area.  You got to check out the restaurant, very cool and the foods not bad at all - just don’t look at the prices. Overall great place to stay in Vegas, "
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We stayed at the Park MGM in September and decided to stay at the NoMad this past weekend to see if it was better.  The Park MGM rooms, although newly remodeled, still show that it was an old hotel (Monte Carlo) that has been updated but not well (poor room layout, low ceiling heights, weird common area on floors).  At the start the NoMad was wonderful.  Exclusive entrance, exceptional front desk and bell staff.  The bell man was VERY attentive and helpful.  The design in general is much better than the Park MGM.  Better finishes, lighting, ambiance in general, however, that all went away upon entering the room.  We stayed in a King room, 32nd floor.  The pros:  high ceiling heights (at Park MGM my 6'3"" husband could almost touch the ceiling), wood flooring, comfortable bed. …"
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"This looks like a really nice hotel and the reviews led me to believe that we would have an awesome time. However, the actual experience was not so great.  While the actual hotel is very nice (although rather dark), our experience with the staff  was extremely disappointing. It started with Valentine's Day. The hotel website said that there was live entertainment starting at 6:00 PM in the NoMad Bar. It also said that you could order bar food or full meals from the menu.My wife and I planned our Valentines Day around listening to the live music and having a nice, full meal in the bar.  In reality, the music did not start until 9:00 PM. And they refused to allow us to order anything but bar food. To make it worse, the woman telling us this could not care less. No apology for the…"
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The NoMad is my home away from home when I travel to Las Vegas. I’ve stayed there for one night to 14 nights on any given trip and the service is always the same, perfect. The staff addresses me by name (and my last name is HARD to pronounce), notices when I look like I need water to offering a recommendation for dinner. I’m not a gambler so it’s all on the merit of being a customer service based property. Have a drink in the bar and dinner in the restaurant. Everyone should stay at least once at the NoMad. I promise you won’t regret it!"
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We had decided to try NoMad because we like their hotel in LA.  We've stayed at many of the other Vegas hotels (e.g. Aria, Wynn, Venetian, Bellagio, Hard Rock, Cosmopolitan, etc.) and were hoping this would be a hip new entrant.  Instead it was kind of ""meh.""  The rooms were nice enough, but the casino and high limit room were very pedestrian, low energy, and nothing special.  Pool area was closed, but looked small and not particularly upscale.  Overall it's fine, but nothing all that cool or special."
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Really nice and, based on my limited Vegas experience, it’s way above average.  But it really lacks the ability to make one feel special. Check in was great.  Very personable.  But once checked in you are dumped into the MGM mayhem and it’s not always so obvious how to get back to the Nomad.  The restaurant, bar, game room, lobby, elevator are all very split up with no cohesiveness.  But the room was very comfortable and clean.  I guess one doesn’t stay long in Vegas as there is no clothing or luggage storage other than a few hangers.  All in all would still recommend. "
NoMad Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,The ambiance of this hotel is totally unique in Las Vegas — truly one of a kind gem on the strip. Awesome service. Great restaurants. Do not miss Juniper if you want to have a great time at a bar. Love this place.
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"I've stayed at Red Rock about ten times while on work and play trips. It's by far the most high end resort in Vegas, the rooms are large and have great soaking tubs. We love hanging out by the pool and there's always a table to play on for $5 or $10. Best of all, it's right next to downtown Summerlin, you can walk across the street and try out all the great restaurants."
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"Red Rock is a great option for those that want to get off of the busy Vegas strip scene. Everything you need for a great Vegas experience is on site. It is especially good if you want to bring the kiddos and have a family trip. There are plant of things to eat on site and nearby. Besides that you have the movie theatre, bowling alley, a family friendly pool, and all gambling needs at your disposal. The kids area costs a bit to drop them off and get babysat if you want but my kids enjoyed it. A solid clean hotel and casino!"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,Very spacious and clean rooms.  The views are amazing.  So many pools to choose from with excellent service poolside.  The gaming was very good with many choices.  The Yardhouse food was excellent ! Met with a friend who relocated to the area and met for lunch.  We gambled at a variety of different machines.  The rooms were quiet.  My view was of the pools and mountains. Ordered room service twice and it came hot and very quick !  Although when checking out they sort of misplaced my car... they offered to comp me a room in the future for my trouble.  The staff were amazing to deal with. Check in and check out were very quick and easy.   I will definitely return.
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"Stayed here from 10/4-10/10 as a stand in for a Mexico vacation we cancelled due to Covid.  The resort is about 25 minutes from the airport.  We used Presidential limo for our transfers and cannot recommend them highly enough.  Our two drivers, Bryan and Bob were on time, friendly and very professional.  I will use their services again for a November trip back to Las Vegas.  The hotel is very modern with a hip breezy vibe.  The staff is exceptional and with the exception of a housekeeping miscue on point every time.  Ben the concierge was patient and had amazing follow through on our requests.  He arraigned for a car rental as well as a bike excursion through Red Rock Canyon and even set up a private bike tour of the canyon when the tour operator did not have enough guests for the regular excursion.  Ben is a great asset to the hotel.  We selected a mountain view king and the view was phenomenal.  You can see the Canyon from the rooms and every night you will be treated to a wonderful sunset.  The rooms themselves come equipped with a flat screen TV, safe, and plenty of charging stations and outlets.  The bathroom is large with Jack and Jill sinks, a separate tub, a shower and a water closet.  A fridge can be added upon request for an additional fee although same is free is needed for medication.  The safe; however, is very small and not ideal for laptops.  One observation, if you have mobility issues request a room nearer to the elevators as they are on one end of the floor and quite far from the other.  The dining on site is diverse and very good overall.  We dined at Hearthstone, the BBQ venue, T-Bones and the Cafe.  The buffet is not open.  Hearthstone has an eclectic menu and wood fired pizza.  The French Onion soup here was a masterpiece.  The pizza was also excellent.  T- Bones is the steak venue and not to be missed.  The décor alone will wow you as well as the food.  Top shelf drinks, an impressive wine list and great entrees is a winning combination.  Mrs. Cowboy had the dover sole which was prepared expertly and I had prime rib.  The prime rib was one of the best I have ever eaten, properly seasoned and temperature spot on.  The chocolate cake for dessert has to be seen to be believed.  One off site dining venue I have to recommend is Vintner's Grill in Summerlin.  We learned of this spot from another reviewer on this site and cannot thank them enough.  This is a special occasion restaurant  and well worth leaving the hotel to sample.  Service here is impeccable, the venue is immaculate and the food delicious.   A great wine list with selections from around the world and diverse enough for anything you select on the menu.    The casino here is nice with a poker room, sports book, and bingo area.  There is a large selection of slots and video poker machines both in smoking and non smoking areas.  Drink service was prompt but it does appear they have less servers Sun-Wed and then add them for the weekend.  There are plenty of table games but most of the live games seem to open only at night or on the weekend.  There is also video craps, video blackjack and roulette in the event the tables are not open.   The resort also boasts a bowling alley, a food court and a movie theater.  This seems to attract many locals from the surrounding Summerlin community.  The resort itself is integrated into  a  larger development with offices, a minor league baseball facility, an ice rink and a very upscale shopping mall.  You will not run out of things to do here.  The on site gym is clean but fairly small.  They have four treadmills, some bikes and weight machines and free weights.  Water and towels are provided and Sue the morning attendant keeps the gym spotless and germ free.  Sadly though, due to Covid, Yoga and TRX classes are not being offered.  The spa was open but not all of the spa amenities are open to guests.  My wife availed herself to a massage with she said was excellent but the sauna, steam showers etc were not open.  There is a spa pool but it is not really that much separated from the main pool.    Which brings me to my only complaint about the resort which is the pool.  The complex itself is large and visually appealing with very comfortable loungers and day beds.  There is a pool restaurant and bar but servers will bring food or drinks to your lounger.  Shade is also widely available as are private cabanas which you can rent.  The huge negative is the pounding, pulsating dance music from which there is no escape.  I understand pool parties are now part of the Vegas experience but there is no relief from the music.  We were outside early on a Monday and the music was over the top.  We stayed all day and it was relentless.  We actually looked forward to the PSA where the staff reminded you to wear a mask just to get some relief from the noise.  I understand the pool party concept and recognize that is what to expect on weekends, but there was no actual party that Monday just the incessant pulsating bass.  Renting a cabana or paying to sit at the spa pool will not save you.  The speakers are everywhere so if you are looking to relax and chill out at the pool beware.  The resort really needs to figure out either a quiet pool option or at least not start the music as early as they do.  The resort is ten minutes from the Red Rock Canyon and you should definitely visit this natural wonder.  The fee for entry is $15.00 per car and you can drive a 13 mile loop with many stops for photos and nature interpretations.  Hiking and biking are also available with multiple trails that range from beginner to expert.  Mrs. Cowboy hiked as well as biked the park and really enjoyed the experience.  The hotel can arrange tours for you or you can do it on your own.    Overall, we enjoyed the resort and the restaurants at Red Rock.  The staff from the valets to the concierges were fantastic and the casino, because it caters more to locals, gives you more value for your dollar than you might find on the strip.  We will return, just not when the pool is open.…"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"Since there is little entertainment on the Strip and many big changes had been made at our favorite eating spots, decided to stay off the strip.  Based on other reviews, Red Rock seemed to be just what we were looking for.  Good thing we didn't go on our first impressions though. Only one standing in line at check-in with three employees on computers. Took five minutes before one would offer any service.  Unhappy, unfriendly young man checked me in with very little else said except the required items.  Other than that, Red Rock is a fantastic resort!  Clean, clean, clean, sanitizing supplies everywhere, temperatures checked upon entering. Rooms very quiet, comfortable, and clean.  Swimming pool was very enjoyable as well.  Most patrons adhered to the masks requirements.  Restaurants we ate at where the Sushi and Italian restaurants.  Sushi just so so, but Italian, amazing experience and will write separate review on that. Do be aware of the very high resort fees that you are charged when booking but definitely would return.…"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"Well, in the age of Covid.... Was really nice to get away.  This property was great.  Rooms very nice.  Like the way the pools were set up; one big one in the middle, then smaller ones around.  Had to get in line at 8:30 (pool opens at 9:00 am) to get seats with an umbrella, but worth it.  Was Labor Day Weekend, so a little crowded, but plenty of social distancing.  Hotel has lots of restaurants, a food court, theater (was great to go to a movie), bowling alley, and arcade.  Outside mall just across the street plus more restaurants."
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"We had the most wonderful stay here. The staff is super friendly, loved the body temp scanners and super clean accommodations. So close to the strip and Summerlin Mall. Many food choices on site and the pool area was like a relaxing retreat . Casino was fabulous. Can’t wait to return 🤩❤️"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"In 30 trips to Vegas - never stayed off Strip. Decided to try Red Rock. Hotel / Resort: Great layout, design, color and lighting throughout.  Hotel entrance is separate from local casino entrance.  All guests had Temperature professionally checked at all entrances including casino.  Rooms are nice. Clean and well appointed. Bed comfort was below average. Valet well run. The pool area looked great - nice layout with multiple pools.  Restaurants:  Plenty of restaurant choices. 8 Noodle Bar small place but great Asian alternative.  T-Bones on the pricey side but food & service was high quality. Sat on the patio - music selection was top notch but volume was too high for a restaurant at that price.  Gambling: Decent size sports book - staffing seemed light Friday - waited 12th in…"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"Spent two night there last week. Don't think I slept either night. Walls and doors do not keep noise out. Hotel allows guests to yell and scream at the top of their voices at all ours of the night. I never saw any security in the hotel  area, only the casino.  Suggestion, if staying in Vegas and you want a good nights sleep, stay at a location without a casino."
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor," Great rooms, numerous restaurants, a beautiful pool area and casino. The staff are friendly and helpful.  The management is taking great steps to comply with the cdc guidelines for covid by taking everyone's temperature at the entrances, requiring/providing face masks and plenty of hand sanitizer stations.  Bravo!  A comfortable resort for a staycation.  "
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"Don't ask me why we chose to ""getaway"" from our strip apartment and head on out to Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa for a staycation, but we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves - felt like we drove for hours (20 minutes) and had a blast.  We actually took a big morning hike up at Mt. Charleston before checking in, relaxing by the pool, gambling (I won my biggest jackpot ever $480), and dining at Lucilles.  They have about 7 choices for dining and the pool bar had great margaritas, cocktails, and wine for our  foursome.  With current COVID low prices the strip has some questionable visitors who look like they crawled out from under a rock - this Red Rock crowd was awesome!  I am talking gorgeous millennials in all shapes and sizes and even nice looking old folks like us - ha ha!  I highly…"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,We have never been there before visiting the area my friend recommended the red rock we went we had dinner at Lucille‘s food was wonderful we couldn’t ask for a better experience to visit with a friend I haven’t seen in two years and my sister that flew in from Minnesota everything was clean and spotless if I’m in the area again I will definitely stay at the red Rock Casino hotel and leave the strip behind thank you for making our Dining experience wonderful
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"First of all, because I was traveling with someone who has a terminal illness and tires easily, I made sure to arrive 1-1/2 hours after check-in, at 4:30.  I valet parked (the valets were nice and professional), and went in to find my ex sitting there, exhausted, with a pool pass in his hand.  He told me they said they didn't have any rooms ready yet.  So, I went to the front desk.  The woman there, who was particularly unfriendly but whose name I did not get, advised me that there were 18 people in front of me and it might be up to an hour.  Oh, she also told me that their check-in is from 3-5; ya might want to mention that on your website in the future!  She said we should go sit by the pool.  Oh, okay, it's 112 outside, smoky as hell, and this guy can barely walk...but we…"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"Coming from Chicago where it’s already jacket weather. The pool is amazing. No problem getting a lounge chair, service is great, the waitresses are friendly and working their butts off in the heat. Prices are super reasonable considering we are in Vegas. Awesome margaritas and Wygu burgers.   The only thing that was annoying are the mask rules that are only enforced for us normal people but not the VIP cabana club areas. If you are seated at a restaurant with other people you can take your mask off. But if you are seated at the pool with other people you cannot. Oh and you can be in the pool with ALL the people and you don’t have to wear one. It doesn’t make sense. Also it’s 90 degrees.   I talked to lots of other visitors and they all agreed it’s pretty silly and quite…"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"First time staying here, had a fantastic time! We stayed for 4 nights, most of our time was spent at the resort even though we rented a car. The rooms, casino and entire complex are clean and well kept. Staff was super friendly / helpful across the board but also left you alone to do your thing if that's what you want. Lots of good food to choose from as well. Food / drink prices are more reasonable than what you would find downtown.  We didn't want to leave when it was time to go home. Thank you to everyone at the Red Rock for making our trip so enjoyable!"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"Stayed for two nights Labor Day and what a fantastic property. The rooms are modern, huge and well appointed with all the amenities you'd expect from a 4-5* star hotel. It was also super clean.  Staff (other than in Grand Cafe) are helpful and willing to help. Any phone call and a request was answered quickly. WiFi easy to connect and fast. Wish the shower could get a bit hotter, but it wasn't cold at all.  The pool is also great. Super nice loungers well spaced out. The water was a bit cold (but there was no sun due to the smoke from California wildfires).   The one negative is hallway noise really travels so you hear anyone walking by talking or closing their door.  The casino is huge and while it allows smoking, it does not smell at all and didn't leave a stench on my…"
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"Took a side trip to Red Rock yesterday on a visit to Vegas. Love this casino and have been a few times now and stayed there twice. Yesterday we stopped at The Bakery on our way out for a treat and weren't disappointed. We made a selection of desserts and took them back to our hotel on Freemont street.  OMG these desserts were heavenly. If you ever go to Red Rock you have to stop in at The Bakery. Great selection, great service and well worth the stop. Definitely making a side trip here on our next visit."
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"My sister booked this spa experience for us to relax and forget about the COVID. It is so great being able to get back to going to the spa with everything go on in the world. My masseuse Marina was absolutely the best. She listened to me when I told her about my fractured ankle, she was very gentle. We got an 80 minute treatment. When we were done we were able to go sit out by the swimming pool."
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,What a fabulous day! While visiting a friend living in Las Vegas I booked us massages. I was escaping being stuck at home during Covid-2020! My friend needed a break too. After realizing she never had a professional massage before-I booked us each a Well and Being 50 minute massage. We both loved it! I feel bad I don’t remember my masseuse name-she was one of the best ever!  Afterwards we were invited to hang out by the spa swimming pool and order lunch. My friend and I met a nice local hairdresser-I’m pretty sure they are friends now.  Wonderful day from beginning to end! 
Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa,TripAdvisor,"Stayed two nights. Had a comfortable king sized bed in the spacious room. Rented a pool cabana. Great time in a private area.Our server, Lindsay, was excellent. Food was good. Unfortunately we lost at the casino."
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I have stayed at other 5 star hotels in Vegas strip before and this place should be a 1 star hotel.  1. Finding the parking garage is confusing AF. 2. Long line to check in. It took 45 minutes. If you ask for late check out, they will charge you for it. Never heard of any type of hotel charge for late check out. 3. Staff are not friendly. 4. Their own pool is closed and forced us to crowd more at the Aria pools.  5. The Aria pool closes at 4 pm. The other competitors closes at 6pm.  6. No complimentary bottled water in the room.  Not recommending this place and Aria to my friends and family. Save your money and stay somewhere else."
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We have stayed at the Vdara 6-7 times over the past 10 years since it opened in 2009.  We tend too like it in the winter months as rates are very attractive for a nice size room.  Due to COVID, we did spend a little more time in the room this trip.  You can really start to see that the resort is starting to show some age and will need to do some work.  Almost all the furniture is showing age and many of the wood end tables had awful drink water marks on them.  The shower drain was clogged up, the toilet ran every 15 minutes and the shower door was very difficult to open.  All these items are thing that houses keeping would and should notice and report for repairs.  This is not COVID related.  If I get a great deal on rates I will still consider staying there again.  However, I will think hard about it as I feel that this is not an important property for MGM since it has no casino.  Now with COVID, capital expenditures to upgrade and replace will not be important.…"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"This is the third time staying at this hotel. Each time the Hotel disappoints more. Had a corner suite. Furniture was badly scratched and marked. Side of chair had some liquid spilled all over it. Two sections of the blinds were missing the blackout blind. The pull out bed was terrible and extra person slept on couch. Why have a full kitchen without utensils, cookware, plates or cups. One ceiling light and two lamps had bulbs that did not work. No maid service due to Covid. I understand that but would have appreciated being told in advance. No room service due to covid. Selection in market in lobby continues to get smaller each time. Miss the Keurig machine in the room. Don't think I will stay here again."
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We stayed at the Vdara property which is the sister property of Aria Resorts and Casino. Their is a walkway that connects them both.  During Covid, hotel takes your temperature upon checkin and masks required entire time. We scored a penthouse 1 bedroom bc cause of the decreased rates.  Room had incredible views since we were on the 54th floor. Could see the water show and Effiel Tower on the strip. Full kitchen, microwave and dining room for 6 people. 2 flat screen TVs and 2 separate bathrooms.  Restaurants and bars downstairs plus Starbucks.  The pool and spa only open at the Aria bc cause of Covid but you can use if you are guest or Vdara. "
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Stayed here 4 years ago and it was fabulous. Love the location and kitchen in the room. This visit was during CoVid so we expected changes. Hand sanitizer and masks were in the lobby and a small kit was left in the room with cloth masks, sanitizer and the metal things to use for elevator buttons.   We stayed in a corner suite (which is the same room type as before). Still love the hotel but it is showing some wear. Carpet and furniture in living room need to be replaced. There was a bathing suit left in the dryer and the washing machine wasn’t working. The morning we were checking out, housekeeping knocked on the door to see if we were gone twice before checkout time. We felt like we needed to rush out. The restaurant had a very limited menu and the bar and Starbucks in the lobby were closed. The front desk staff was friendly and efficient as always. Would probably stay here again because there aren’t many choices that offer a full kitchen, but it is definitely due for an update. …"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"All staff we came into contact with were helpful and friendly. Pool was closed when we stayed but we could use the Aria pool and it was beautiful. Entire resort and rooms were clean and sanitizer/mask rules were enforced, which was comforting. 24 hr security checked room keys at the elevators and made us feel safe. Loved the location! So convenient to most things we planned to do on our trip. Our room was beautiful, had an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. Kitchenette with microwave, burners and mini fridge was super convenient since we stayed for 3 nights.  Beautiful bathroom and shower. Bed was so comfy, and loved the media system. We had dinner at Catch in the Aria and would definitely recommend if you love seafood and a beautiful ambiance. Will definitely be staying…"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Let me start off by 1st saying that there were great things that the staff did extremely well with but unfortunately the bad was bad.   I would like to first of all thank their agent Nayeli who accommodated my booking.  We asked for some request and although not guaranteed, Nayeli delivered.  My next trip to Vegas which will be soon Ill be stopping by to drop you off a much deserved tip mark my words (left in a rush).  I appreciate the precaution that the pool takes in regards to covid.  They practice good social distance, enforce people to wear mask, and attend people well.    on to the bad.    We requedted dishes because we were going to cook in our room but they weremt deliver... no biggie we called back and they delivered.    I called back the next day to have the room…"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Quality hotel but first:  Vegas is a bit different during this unique time.  The strip was quiet except at night.  We figured since there are no shows going on everyone is walking on the strip at night.  With Cannabis legal and cheep hotel rooms there is definitely a younger crowd than in the past.  You can catch a buzz by just walking the strip,  I don't care one way or the other but it is different.   Also no trams between hotels and limited bus service means you will get some steps in.  Now for the hotel  Vdara is part of MLife properties - let me say all MLife properties did an outstanding job  with regard to cleanliness and safety.  There were plastic shields at the lounges and table games between chairs and staff was respectfully enforcing face coverings.  Most of the…"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We checked into the Vdara in a desperate attempt to save our vacation, as filthy conditions at a previous hotel drove us out.  We had only a couple of days in Vegas and I decided to bite the bullet and stay at a pricier place.  As it turns out, Vdara was only slightly more expensive when all was said and done.  And what a difference.  The view from the 36th floor was unreal, even though the Bellagio Fountains were off.   We didn't have an unobstructed view of the strip, but the lights spreading out over the city and beyond were magical.  The king bed and separate living area really made it feel much less like a hotel room and more like an upscale apartment.  And with the price of take-out, it was great to have a fridge for leftovers.  I felt like a princess in the giant soaking…"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"My wife and I stayed for our anniversary again last month.  Check in went painless.  We requested a one bedroom loft on the 56 floor.  Room was nice with a full kitchen 11/2 bath with a sunken tube.  Great views on both floors.  All covid requirements was followed,  Masks and sanitizers were provided ,  Special consideration to the front desk agents Amber and Elias.  Felt safe.  Amost forgot Mike of Security."
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Rooms were really big which I guess is common in Vegas. Location is good. That's where the positives stop unfortunately. Room wasn't clean. Staff could be rude and unhelpful at times. Starbucks was always full with long queues. 
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"check in was slow even tho there wasnt a line. lobby/check in staff seemed to know how to properly do their job but werent friendly at all. we stayed on the 52nd floor, had an amazing view of the fountains. the bathroom was large and had a deep soaking tub that was great. When we first arrived, found leftover food in the fridge ( that wasnt even chilly) from previous guests so the room didnt feel clean. disappointing at the price we paid to stay there"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,My wife and I took advantage of reduced rates due to being an M Life Rewards member. We stayed during Labor day weekend. Our first room was not clean and once the night housekeeper confirmed this and told management the cleanliness did not meet Vdara's standards we were moved to a different room. Management comped all our resort fees for the stay which was awesome and much appreciated. The bed was okay. The view was unbelievable. There was not any silverware or dinnerware available to properly use the kitchen. Bathroom was awesome. A huge downside was the Spa and fitness center was not available due to COVID19. We were told we could use Aria's but then we attempted to do this we were told there was limited availability for hotel guests. Pool was refreshing and utilized each day.…
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,We stayed in a corner fountain view room and cannot speak highly enough of I️t. I️t had full kitchen washer and dryer. We travel allot and one if not the best hotel we have ever stayed. The room and hotel very clean and love the fact no casino connected tonight. . You do have to walk through Aria to get to Las Vegas Blvd. Special thanks to Kerryn for upgrading us from a studio suite. We will only stay here when we return to Vegas. 
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Pros - staff is very friendly and helpful when you can get in touch with them. Check in was fast. Self parking was easy. Location is great. Hotel lobby area is nice, clean and spacious. Dog park is convenient and well kept.   Cons - Our room smelled HORRIBLE upon arrival, we had to leave so they could deodorize and it still couldn’t get the smell out. It takes a long time to get front desk or housekeeping, extremely long hold times of 5+ min. Pullout couch is a bit and very uncomfortable. Rooms are kind of worn, holes in sheets, stains on carpet. Scuffs all over furniture and walls.   We stayed here through air bnb rental. Will unfortunately be the last time.  "
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,We enjoyed our stay.  Only bump was when we arrived to our room it reeked of marijuana .  The manager on duty was nice enough to relocate us to a higher floor with a better view and comped us the resort fee.  The new room was great with a view of the fountains and very clean.  We called housekeeping every other day to service the room and they did a great job.  The beds are very comfortable. Self parking was a breeze and we lucked out with good spots each time. I would certainly stay here again.
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"What may have once been an excellent hotel is definitely feeling the impact of staffing shortages. As Las Vegas locals we wanted a nice staycation to celebrate our first wedding anniversary but in the future will probably opt for another hotel given our mediocre time here.   We checked in at 3:30pm but our room wasn’t ready, so they gave us a $50 food and bev credit and took our phone number to call us when the room was ready. 4 hours later and no call, we returned hoping the room was ready, which fortunately it was. Despite being M life members we had to queue up in the regular line. The receptionist apologized for the lack of a phone call and inconvenience and once again offered another $50 in food and bev credit. At this point it was 7:30pm and their only place open was the…"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We stayed here for one night at the end of a trip through the southwest. The location is convenient for anyone interested in doing things on the Strip, although the signage to self- parking was confusing. Check- in was extremely slow, but the staff were friendly and helpful. The resort fee of $45 per room per night is, frankly, absurd; this is a hidden fee that enables this hotel (and others) to advertise lower room rates. The room itself was spacious and visually pleasing. Everything was clean, if a bit worn. The bed was okay - a bit lumpy. Views out of the nice big windows were pleasant, even though we weren't overlooking anything special. All in all, it was a pretty good stay, but I don't know that we'd stay again unless the room was comped.  Self-parking is free currently…"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The Vdara was booked on a whim because I like the draw of a non-casino hotel. To my surprise, this property became one of my favorites immediately.   I booked a City Corner Suite. Front desk staff was fantastic about answering all my questions about the property and the amenities that they had. I got to my room and found that the room was damaged. The walls had large scratches across the walls and the furniture was also damaged. I went back down to the front desk and showed them the photos of the room. They apologized and immediately moved me to a new room. They even went up with me to make sure the room was in a good condition. That's fantastic service!   The City Corner Suite was HUGE. Dare I say that it was actually too big for one person. I felt like I was in a penthouse…"
Vdara Hotel & Spa at ARIA Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"A very comfortable hotel Spacious rooms Quieter than all other Las Vegas hotels Ok for the service Ok the bar I like the low profile design, but very warm at same time Front desk staff very professional, same for housekeeping"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,The Trump International Hotel is the best hotel I have ever stayed in and I have traveled world wide. Service from the entire staff was excellent for the entire week we stayed. Location is right off the strip so you are close to the Vegas action. Will definitely return on our next visit to Vegas.
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Had a great time, the rooms were amazing and so comfortable.  Food in the DJT  was amazing,  the staff is always a delight ready to help in any way your hearts desire.  The pool was super clean and the choices of food top notch."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"It’s a well managed hotel with friendly and efficient services.  The food is very delicious.  The room is clean, quiet  and spacious with kitchen. Staffs are very helpful on information. Very enjoyable stay. "
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The Trump Hotel was beautiful and luxurious.  We were able to upgrade our room to a suite.  The suite was large and luxurious.  It as the best part of our stay!  However, the restaurant had a limited menu and the waiter was ""stressed out"".  The food was okay, except for the Caesar salad which was disappointing.  The other real negative was the Valet Parking. When we requested our vehicle, at 9AM, it took more than 30 minutes to before our vehicle was available.  On checkout, at 4AM, we talked to the Valet and our vehicle was waiting for us.  Overall: Beautiful hotel, but the restaurant and valet parking were disappointing.  The hotel needs to increase staffing and improve the menu."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Always a great place to stay, whether for business or leisure. Food is outstanding. The standard rooms are huge. The mall is across the street, which opens us numerous options for dining and stocking the room with snacks."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The trump hotel was amazing! The staff was friendly and genuine, the restaurant/bar was affordable And very good, the accommodations were beautiful clean and comfortable. I will definitely go back and seek other Trump hotels when I travel in the future."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Spacious rooms with very comfortable beds. Quality fixtures and a yuge :) shower. It's like staying at a really nice house. The outdoor pool is awesome for lap swimming. Also the restaurant is very good and the prices, while still high, were not as bad as other places on the Strip."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Celebrating our 12 year anniversary we decided to stay at trump hotel.best decision we made.The rooms are very nice and clean, the views are stunning, very kind and excellent customer service. We are looking forward for our next getaway and this time with the rest of the family. "
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Loved our stay here.  Beautiful, spacious, high quality room. Sparkling clean. Fabulous bathroom. Great view.  No casino in the hotel, so it feels like a calm sanctuary coming off of the chaotic Las Vegas strip (which is a 3-4 minute walk away).  From check-in to check-out, very attentive service.  Restaurant was quite good too.  Highly recommend!"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I have been staying in the 3 bedroom penthouse 3-4 times a year for about 5 years running now. Trump international Las Vegas is like my home away from home. All of the people who greeted me at my first visit are still working here. I work with the same reservation specialist every time I book. The valet team knows us by name, and I even get a HUG from them because they're excited to see us again. Staying at Trump gives you a taste of old Las Vegas when the hotels were guest, not corporate, focused. It's simply a wonderful experience and I wouldn't stay anywhere else if you GAVE me a suite. The level of service, care and attention the Trump staff team offers is unmatched and when you travel as much as I do, you need a place to call home when you are on the road; Trump Las Vegas…"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Having stayed at another Trump property and been very impressed, we were elated to see a Trump property available in Las Vegas at such an affordable rate. The lobby was exquisite as expected. The quality we expected from the Trump brand stopped there. The exterior of the hotel was nice enough, but the “druggies” laying down on the benches by the front doors were not. I also understand smoking pot is legal in Las Vegas, and to each their own, but stepping out of the car at the entrance that’s all you could smell. Staff were polite and courteous, but not in a hurry about anything. After checking in and calling down to request extra bedding for the pullout sofa, we had to wait for hours. My husband had to return to the lobby to reiterate our request. Around 1:45am they finally…"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I have been at Trump Towers four times now and this place is just great! They have beautiful rooms with kitchenettes, and my daughter loooves their jacuzzis and their swimming pool area. So much relaxing! Also, they have wonderful staff. Only thing they need to change is their pillows. Too soft 😊"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The hotel was all around an amazing experience. It was clean, beautiful, had fantastic service, the pool was fun, and the food/drink was delicious. It isn't a long walk from the strip and provides a relaxing break from the hustle and bustle of the city. I would definitely be staying there again."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"This was by far the best room I had in Las Vegas. Two full bathrooms and a full kitchen with wolf/Sub Zero appliances...Amazing. Strip view was great, night and day. Easy access to the room and spa. Great for families. No casino was fine, plenty of casino action minutes away."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Whatever you might think of President Trump, this hotel of his *really* is great. If you like not hearing the 'clang, clang, clang' of slot machines in the morning and having to deal with a waft of smoke while walking through the lobby, then this is the place for you. My wife said this was the best hotel in Las Vegas she has ever stayed in...and I am inclined to agree."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Staying at the trump was an experience I won’t forget. So nice to be away from the main strip filled with sleazy smoke and gambling atmosphere. Honestly this is a hotel beyond us but I’m glad we stayed here for our second anniversary. They put us near the top with the strip side view that’s unmatchable. This hotel is just luxury and at a value. Trump staff makes you feel important.
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Clean rooms, very spacious, off the strip so nice & quiet, No casino so not stinky or noisy, excellent security so it’s very safe, wonderful customer service/staff! We have Stayed here 6 times now and it’s consistently awesome!! "
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I enjoyed my stay here because it was non-smoking, non-gaming and just off the strip. Nice hotel with heavier decorations but big rooms and great views. Quiet for being just off the strip. Nice fitness and pool areas. Very friendly staff. Just one block off the strip for easy walking and you can cut through the Fashion Mall to avoid the heat. Quick commute to the airport too. No complaints from me."
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I chose this hotel because there is no smoking and no casino.  Yes, no casino in Las Vegas - why? I like to be relaxed and refreshed. From the moment we arrived this was the right choice.  The check-in was smooth and pleasant.  I requested a higher floor ... going up, next stop floor 51! The room was very clean and the cleaning staff were great.  The valet was prompt.  Ordered my car by text when leaving my room.  It was ready when I got to the entrance.  The valet always offered to provide directions of I needed them. The restaurant in the lobby, DLT, had good food and speedy service.  Limited menu though. My only compliant was a Covid imposed issue so not totally the hotel's fault.  We had a room with a kitchen.  There were no kitchen items in the room.  They delivered upon…"
Trump International Hotel Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Due to Covid restrictions at a place where we had a planned RCI vacation we had to cancel and this was available to book instead.  We had a one bedroom unit, with living room and kitchen and the biggest bathroom we'd ever seen in our lives.  Not like any place we had been before and nothing we could ever afford had it not been an RCI exchange.  We're used to doing for our selves so their service took a little getting used to.  Our unit was clean and comfortable.  We had no problem with noise.  We never felt unsafe.  Staff was wonderful!  Highly recommend."
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"very friendly stuff, very clean rooms…..good food. good and perfect to hang out with friends. clean machines, i love going there to play and use my points… quiet place to spend a getaway with friends and family. there restrooms are very clean. the cleaners are so friendly it feels like home."
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"I have been a customer at the M for 2 years now, the hotel and casino is very nice but the service is mostly terrible. I have gotten some good service and pleasant team members but most of all some of the same team members have terrible issues with people of color and they should be placed on the unemployment line"
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"My husband & I have stayed here 2 times this year & have had great experiences both times. Friendly staff, clean property & rooms, great location, would highly recommend. Both times we have stayed in rooms with a strip view, soaking tub is the best as you have the view of the city lights from the room, multiple restaurants @ the hotel to choose from, . Hotel is close to the freeway & about 15mins to the strip & if you're a Raiders fan you'll really like the hotel."
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"Luxurious Hotel in a perfect location, away from the strip noise but close enough for an Uber ride. Friendly staff. The view from my room was superb, you are looking at the Las Vegas Strip in the distance"
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"M resort and spa is amazing. Yes the resort is off the strip like 15 min away but between the pool, spa, casino and multiple restaurants not much of a reason to leave M resort and spa. A manager named Brandon really made our stay. He went above and beyond to make our stay perfect. He was so helpful and kind. I will be telling my family and friends to come here."
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,I love the cleanliness and the team members. Even thou people smoke it is not overwhelming you can’t even smell it. Great returns on your reward card. Amazing restaurants. Love burgers and brew and Vig deli. 
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"We always love the M resort. This time was no different.  Food was great ........ employees always friendly and know their stuff.  Rooms always very clean.    This time on the 2nd day , my wife and I BOTH won    ( which always makes it a fine time..... lol )   Our Casino Host Brandon is a SUPER guy and took care of us.  Everything is 1st class."
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"During this pandemic I was pleased to see almost all guests wearing masks. All staff is nice and the room was big and spotless. There is one thing that I do not quite understand though and that bothered my extremely. The hotel requests that you wear masks at all times when you are at the pool, except when in the water. I am absolutely pro masks, but this strange rule does not make any sense to me. Instead of spacing out the sun beds, making sure there are at least 6 ft between parties, they make you wear masks when on your sun bed. Which of course leads to basically all people sitting in or by the pool so they can take their masks off. In my opinion this stupid rule is achieving the opposite. The pool is super crowded, people cannot maintain 6 ft distance and they do not wear…"
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"Lots of machines, clean and safe and good food. What else can you ask for! The employees are helpful.   Menus have something for everyone. Safe distance between machines.  Lots of good parking. We go to eat and play every week."
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"Since announcing themselves as the raiders Hotel the clientele has declined drastically.   Most are drinking and yelling and not gaming, few wearing masks appropriately.   Just not my scene anymore.   I’m hoping it improves as they realize the loss of gaming visitors because of the ghetto clientele"
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"Let’s start by saying the M Resort is beautiful. I’ve been here before for dinner & have always wanted to experience the pool.  With my better half leaving tomorrow for a couple of months, her request was to head over to her favorite pool at M Resort. Security was friendly especially entering the property. Pool staff was friendly including the VIP host & the GM of the Pool.   As someone who ran one of the largest Hotels in the Country, I was shocked that at 1:30pm when we arrived that Upper Management did not want to reduce the price for a daybed or a cabana. They specifically prefaced to me that they have a lot of their daybeds available for the rest of the day. When I expressed that we arrived with half the day left & asked if we could get a half day rate. They explained that…"
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"Mamas & Families - this hotel is not for you. Just recently a mama was feeding her infant by the pool and she was asked to leave to feed her baby in the bathroom. Is she supposed to sit on a toilet and feed her child?!  This is appalling, and the staff is not well trained. Please don’t support this resort. "
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,We are staying at the M for the month of July! The rooms are beautiful! The bathrooms are large with a bath tub and stand up shower and double sinks! Tv in the mirror! Very first class! The lobby is beautiful! Very friendly staff! The pool is fantastic and the service by the pool is out standing! The food is very good! Now for what I don’t like! The spa is closed Monday's! You can not work out until it opens and they don’t open until 9am! You have to go through the spa to work out! This is terrible! The pool gets a little crowded because they let anyone come in from outside if the pay money! This is also terrible and makes it hard for guests to get a lounge chair! They need to stop this
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"Without exception, the M resort is absolutely the best casino and hotel in Las Vegas. It is easy to get into and out of, the rooms are immaculate and very well-designed, the customer service is second to none, and the cocktail waitresses are the most gorgeous anywhere. The restaurants in buffet are top notch as well."
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,We are locals and spent one night for a staycation night. We have spent time in the casino and restaurants but have never in the hotel.  We were overall disappointed.   Pluses: -allowed early checkin; nice pool  Negatives: - pool closed around 11:30 am due to high winds; our floor appeared full as lots of people in the hall going back & forth and lots of “ do not disturb” signs on; paper thin walls exasperated by next door partiers. We complained after several hours of this and was told the hotel was “full” as they were only using 5 floors. This does not seem to me a good strategy of keeping guests “safe” from the virus - just group them all together!  Our room did not appear particularly clean. No covering on the remote. Rooms appear dated.  The front desk did waive our resort…
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"Went to the pool for the day and have to say that the bartender, Summer, was the best to deal with. She was so positive and upbeat every time I went to get a drink. So professional and very engaging with everyone. She was very attentive and seemed to remember my drink every time I went up. Will definitely go back! Ask for Summer if you get to spend a day at the pool!"
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"Absolutely the most outstanding resort with the caring, polite, helpful, attentive staff to the  impressively beautiful resort and amenities.  The cocktail service during gaming is exceptional and the quality of beverages too.  The restaurants are outstanding.  When you experience the M RESORT I am sure you will return.  In my opinion they have the most generous players program from gifts, multipliers, fabulous promotions, poolside concerts while you swim to an indoor concert pavilion. Also I am very sensitive to casino smoking.  The M Resort has the very best air filtration system.  My eyes are never irritated and my clothes NEVER smell like smoke.  "
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"Home is where you feel comfortable and we do feel at home at MResort and Spa!  The variety of games, the awesome service, the restaurants.....all first-class.  We are here 4 times a week most weeks and haven't had a bad thing to say ever!"
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"This was a first class hotel and casino. Everyhing was clean and first class all the way. The people were very friendly, from the check in, to the staff that cleaned the rooms, to the casino staff and the restaurant staff. I highly recommend this hotel and casino."
M Resort Spa Casino,TripAdvisor,"Nothing. I think your casino is very nice. I go to casinos closer to my house. Although the Station Casinos have a lot of giveaways that I get maulers for (ie. pull tabs, free gifts, free buffets, kiosk games, etc) I will say that those giveaways do draw me to those casinos. Maybe if you sent me a mailer offering me a gift, etc, I might be more likely to visit your casino."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,It’s was a covid bday stay everything was clean beautiful and amazing I wish I could have stay more days even the pool area was great mask was in force every where in the hotel casino was clean and the food was amazing 
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor," We were really excited to come back to the Mandalay Bay because we were very impressed with our stay 10 years ago. We come to Vegas often and have enjoyed our stays at various other hotels on the strip but we were sorely disappointed with our most recent stay at the Mandalay Bay. We stayed in  a king suite, it was lackluster. The bathroom was nice and bed comfortable but the room could use an upgrade. There were eye lashes in the sink and random styrofoam bowls and solo cups in the cabinets which make me question their cleaning quality. We have been traveling throughout this Covid Pandemic and have been impressed with how various locations have handled it. Disney World’s implementation was impressive as they followed and enforced strict protocol BUT also provided great customer service and a wonderful experience UNLIKE the Mandalay Bay. It was a very impersonal experience with lots of rules but absolutely no customer service. They made it almost impossible to spend money or have a good time. Our room was not available at check in at 3:00pm. The staff was cold, impersonal, and not very helpful. I was not impressed and will not be back. …"
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"Stayed 9 nights in a one bedroom penthouse with my girlfriend. The room nice, clean, and beautiful. Staff at check in seemed like they would have rather been unemployed collecting the stimulus money still. Long wait times. Location of hotel is miserable. Staff wasn’t friendly. M-life just gave constant problems. Just all in all... wouldn’t stay here again. Better hotels in Vegas to stay at"
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"The room was not clean for my 3-night stay, the wait at restaurants to get service is of at least 30 minutes. I found hair in my food they just replace the part where the hair was the waiter did not even say sorry"
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"we went for three days it was great, friendly staff,good service,free parking and the beach pool area was awesome.  i do recommend a penthouse suite lots of room to hang out and enjoy a few drinks before you go out. "
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,This is a great place to relax as well as get in on the action. The hotel and casino were always very clean and I saw every surface being cleansed. I would highly suggest The Mandalay Bay on your next Vegas trip. 
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,Being charged to use the refrigerator is the craziest thing I’ve encountered at a hotel. They filled the fridge with their items hoping you’ll use it so they charge you.  Being unable to use a simple fridge was such A turn off. Otherwise the hotel was beautiful. Far away from the strip but close to the airport.
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,Beds were amazing and spacious room  Staff was friendly and helpful  Shower and bath was great Room was very clean  Room stayed cool and  comfortable  Great location will be staying here again  Would recommend to anyone
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"We wanted to stay on the strip but didn't want to be in the middle of it all, so this choice was perfect at the far south end. Our 59th floor room faced the strip which was a fantastic view. The hotel also connects to Luxor, which was a bonus.   The room was spacious and very clean. We stayed in a Stay Well room which had extra air purifiers and aromatherapy, very nice.   The hotel was quiet, and even the casino was very low key compared to so many others. If you are looking for quiet refinement, I think this is a good choice. The pool area was also lovely but due to COVID mostly closed and with masks, but that could not be helped at the time.  "
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"We got the media suite, it was incredible!  I wish we would have gotten some instruction on how to use all of the features, but it was still awesome.  We will get this room again next time we are in Las Vegas. "
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"16$ for a bottle of water in the room and 10$ for coffee? Motel 6 offers free coffee. I had a king suite, and had to pay for coffee and water. Price gouging at its worst and the opposite of customer loyalty. Tables were all full and refused to open any more, as several of us were trying gamble, which is why we came and why Vegas exists. "
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,Water was off 2 days of my stay due to maintenance there was no courtesy call to inform me that the water would be off I wasn’t put in another room to accommodate us and those days wasn’t waived as they promised they only waived one resort fee from my stay 
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"I choose this place for the pool, such a great lazy river, and wave pool. But the fridge in the room really upset me, I can understand not taking anything out of the fridge or be charged but you also can’t put anything in the fridge, I am a breast feeding mom and I poured a lot of breast milk down the drain because you simply can’t use the fridge in your room unless you want to pay $50. Also, nowhere on-site to warm up your food late night, so anything you have leftover hopefully it will taste good cold because you won’t be able to heat it up later."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,It was nice around the pool area. The pool staff were doing a lot of complaining about masks but they weren’t wearing them. The restaurants in the pool area were not open on a Friday and Saturday so you had to leave for lunch and that was inconvenient.
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,Fantastic hotel. Great staff. Smells clean. The bathroom shower door was difficult to open. It was super clean though and the bed so comfortable. Will def be there again soon. Need comp rooms for more trips!
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"We enjoyed our stay but it would have been very nice to lay in the sun with our masks off since no one was any closer than 10 feet to us, but they had people offering masks and reminding everyone to use then if they were not in the water. "
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"Always amazed when staying here. Rooms, casinos, restaurants are always so clean & staff is always friendly. Even though times are different with COVID I felt they were doing an amazing job to keep everyone safe! Love the location & took advantage of free parking."
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"The hotel was nice and clean. The check in staff were extremely helpful and nice. However, all the rooms are all next to eachother and if you want to play music and dont have friendly vegas vibing neighbors they’ll call security on you. "
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,Water did not work for first 2 days. We complained on several occasions that we had been unable to shower. Only response was to move us to a much lower floor and “refund” the resort fees. I checked out Monday and 2 days later I have still not received a receipt from my trip. 
Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino,TripAdvisor,"As a Vegad local took advantage of the cheaper Sunday and Monday weekdays. All money well spent, Great Service, Exceptional Amenities....However, looking for decent priced food? Dont plan on always eating here...even the food court is outrageously overpriced. Aside from that, all in all, great place to stay and isolated spot on the Strip for better privacy."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The Waldorf Astoria is by far one of the best hotels on the strip and one of the best hotels you can visit during the pandemic, especially for people who don't gamble like me.  The uber/lyft pick up is right downstairs. You don't have to walk for 15 minutes to go to one of the 3 lobbies that is dedicated for rideshare. If you intend to uber/lyft to places outside of CityCenter, the WA is one of the best hotels to stay at.   The water closest is clutch. When asking for more towels (for people like me who don't need their room cleaned every day), there's a door outside your room that connects to a space in your closet that allows room service to drop things off, like towels. This was really convenient for me as no one knocked on my door while I was on a meeting call.  Additionally, the separate closet area is huge, probably too large for me. It had a nice space to open your luggage, so a luggage rack wasn't needed. It was nice having a separate closet area so that you aren't in view of your clothes the entire stay.  The bathtub and bathroom is awesome. A lot of hotels, especially if they're old, have showers that leak, but the WA's bathtub was very enjoyable.   The internet is fast - I was downloading at about 10MB/s, which is way more I get at other hotels. This allowed me to hop on Zoom calls with ease.  As a Diamond member, I had $50 of credits a day. However, they only had one cafe open - Zen Cafe. The food wasn't bad at all. My only complaint was that the large coffee cost $10, but it was pretty much free.  When I stayed in Vegas, the WA was at a similar price to the Bellagio, which is dated and gross compared to the WA. If you don't gamble, consider staying here.…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Was a little concerned based on some bad reviews but was extremely relieved to find just about all were unfounded. First and foremost, it really is the service that makes this hotel and the service we received was truly 5-stars. Yuri at the front desk was phenomenal and even remembered to ask us at check out how are dinner the night before was. Pool/gym staff were also very nice and were constantly disinfecting lounge chairs after they were used. Pool was not busy at all surprisingly and was a calm oasis on the strip vs. other resorts.  Breakfast was extremely good with fresh choices and Christina was great at keeping us up to date when a table opened up, Kenneth was phenomenal as our waiter. Valet staff was even kind enough to open the door for our Uber when he arrived. As a Diamond, we received an upgrade to a strip view room and a $50 F&B credit.  Yes, the rooms are definitely tired and that is the one thing I'll agree with other guests. The labels on the switches were peeling off so it was hard to tell what the switches did. Also there was a huge gash on in the hardwood floor. The hotel is very well used from its days as a Mandarin Oriental so a refurbishment would truly put it back as one of the top hotels on the Strip. Would definitely come back though either way.…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Love the tea at Waldorf Astoria. Usually I would give it 5 stars. We come every year for my wife’s Halloween birthday. They do an amazing job with the food and the view. Even the champagne and tea menu is excellent. We are disappointed with the charge for parking. There isn’t a parking lot so you are forced to valet. Even though we spent 400$ on tea they still want 20$ for the two cars that came to tea. This is wrong! Everyone in Las Vegas is needing help but I think the valet should be complimentary if you gamble or eat a meal. Sad really. Hopefully they remedy this by next year or we might have to look for another tea in Las Vegas. 
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The Waldorf Astoria was a very nice place to stay for a relaxing four days on the Las Vegas strip. My check in process began with a nice, cordial young lady named Chanti that took care of all of my intricate requests. Our room had a complicated lighting arrangement and Ed, the engineer simplified the process and explained the problem. Even though the breakfast choices were quite limited, Juan made sure all went well in the eating area. It was nice to get text messages daily from April and Jeremy, the guest services managers to insure that my stay was going to my liking(which it most certainly was). The final allowance of applause goes out to Matt the bellman. This gentleman provided impeccable guest service from my first day of contact with him until he placed my items in my Lyft drivers vehicle for the ride to the airport. Great location, quiet, elegant hotel worth every penny that my friend and I paid for.…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"I spent two nights here during my birthday/ Valentine’s Day and i must say that everything was excellent. For me, this is my fist time to stay in the Waldorf Astoria Group Hotel, i think the design of the hotel and the service is really great.   The hotel is on the prime location on the Strip, near shopping and casinos. As for the room, due to the Hilton Honors Diamond Membership and American Express FHR program, I have a room upgraded . The room with an amazing, stunning Strip views, was very neatly kept, clean, and comfortable, and i love the glass-enclosed bathrooms and luxe amenities.   Overall, my stay was really enjoyable, its a precious memories stay in our life. I absolutely love view and the location of the hotel. And i hope i can they their suite next time.   I would like recommend Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas for you for having a trip.…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"HIGHLY recommend this hotel. Every staff member is professional, helpful, and friendly. The rooms are amazing and very comfortable. We were here during COVID so the spa wasn't open, but the desk arranged for us to have in-room massages and Grace gives an incredible massage. The pool is beautiful. One thing I especially appreciated was the ability to schedule housekeeping around our schedule. We requested 2:00 pm and that was no problem. Everything about this hotel was outstanding. I highly recommend staying at this propoerty."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,It’s dosnt get any better than Jenleen!!!   I haven't even checked in yet and she has helped to make my accommodations memorable.   She was able to make reservation for our activities and dinners .  The kicker is when she actually  followed up !!!   They don’t make hospitality professionals like her any more !
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We had a wonderful stay at the fabulous Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas! the staff were amazing 👏 Lauren, Jeremy, Mariana and Chani were professional friendly and attentive...everyone flowed the current protocols and guidelines to make us feel safe during these challenging times!"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"How can I start off? Let’s just say I checked in on September 20, 2020 @ 3pm and was put into 3 different rooms because of housekeeping issues. Finally after 2 rooms the 3rd room I ended up taking which still had some problems. The Manager at the front desk was very apologetic but after reading other reviews I see that this hotel is starting to become a 1 star hotel. Anyway I go up to my 3rd room which is 2219, the room has no alarm clock, tv remote missing, a/c that doesn’t even get cold, no hot water. I can keep going on. But I managed to make things work. The only downside about this whole situation was no upgrades or comps were given due to my situation. Nothing. Do I recommend this hotel? it’s hard to say, but in all honestly I will say NO. Stay else were. Oh btw you have…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"This hotel is now unsafe and understaffed. The entrance to the hotel had no visible security which allowed Vegas ""nightlife"" to congregate out front and threaten my wife while waiting for food delivery. Needless to say, sanitation becomes a concern then as well.   We booked a very nice and expensive room. There were zero food options onsite before 5pm. The furnishings in the penthouse are dated and damaged as is the technology in the room. Bottom line, Vegas is not a good place to visit right now. Even if you have to stop and stay and are wanting to put your trust in a luxury brand like the Waldorf - don't! It's just as bad if not worse."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,I had to be in Vegas for work and my wife decided to come along and so did another couple. This hotel leaves much to be desired and sadly we will not be back. In no way does this hotel live up to WA brand standards.   There were some positives but not nearly enough to make this a property anyone should consider until major investment has been made.   Pros:  Pool staff including Carin.  Ease of check-in using the Hilton app to bypass the front desk.   Sky bar.   Cons:  Horrible condition of the hotel overall.   Little to no functioning food currently.   Sparsely furnished rooms.   Lack of plugs in the room.   Inconsistent application of policies.   On the positive side the staff that was working was quite nice and personable. Carin at the pool was a rockstar and certainly needed…
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We came to the Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas for my birthday and had the best time ever.   The hotel is in a great location and in walking distance to everything. There is a Walgreens across the street, it came in handy a few times. The employees were very nice and made our stay a very pleasant one. The rooms were clean with a view of the strip. Our beds were so comfortable and the pillows were the best. Anything we needed were brought to us upon request.  The pool was great. There was plenty of lounge chairs for everyone. They have cabanas too that were available to rent for the day. At night time they open the Skybar. You can get an amazing seat with a great view off the strip.  There is no casino at this hotel. We are not gamblers so we did not miss it and actually like the fact…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Beautiful from the lobby throughout. Staff is so polite. 3 pools and plenty of Cabanas with an outdoor bar. Bath salts were a nice touch, soft robes and the soaps smell amazing. Beautiful view and comfy beds. By far my favorite hotel and so glad I got to spend my birthday here."
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Since the world is at a pause and we are in pandemic, but we all have some life moment to celebrate, so why not do a getaway.  I recently went to celebrate my birthday and stayed at this hotel, I have stayed here a few times, but this time was different because the world is different. I was scared like everyone but took all the precautions, and the hotel did too. As you walk in the front desk is now located where the bell desk use to be, and the elevators don't have the sofa bed they use to [which was nice but understand why]. When you check in the front desk gives you a bag with a disposable face mask and two swabs. Personally the M life location [Aria] gave a COVID kit with a branded cloth face mask, boatel of hand sanitizer, and a key chain thing to push the keys. [Waldorf…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Pretty disappointed in our last stay at the Waldorf, while the hotel's lobby was beautiful and check-in was great, it was all downhill from there. We stayed in an *upgraded* one bedroom suite but was very dated and even had a good-sized hole in the carpet by the bed. Room was also very dusty (maybe because it sat empty due to COVID but don't think of a dusty room when I stay at a Waldorf. We were also very disappointed with the lack of available staff and amenities that were available. The breakfast offering was nothing more than a coffee cart with one employee taking orders for the entire hotel serving hardly more than instant oatmeal yogurt and a couple of hot dishes. They also offered $8 drip coffee. We went to the pool and again one bartender taking food orders and making…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We spent Mon-Thurs at the WA Las Vegas. I wanted to go during the week to minimize activity around people with COVID going on. While I don’t regret my decision, I wish I didn’t spend my points on this stay. It was cheap enough that I should’ve saved the points and just spent the money on the room. Vegas was busy(ish) for weekdays. Still needed reservations for Carmines, Javiers, and Joe’s Prime steakhouse.  About the stay: Everyone went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of and were so nice. Beware of COVID restrictions and what’s open. Staff was great though. Food: I was not happy that there is basically no food on property aside from a morning cafe or snacks at the bar at night. We went to Vegas to hang out by the pool and 3 of our 4 days didn’t have drink…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The staff as usual is extremely professional, friendly, courteous and accommodating. However, it doesn’t have the “Waldorf Astoria” feeling whatsoever. Arrived on a Friday noon and by Sunday afternoon the room had not been cleaned once! Upon bringing it up to the front desk they claim it due to COVID and room cleaning is only done upon request. I can understand that approach, but what I cannot get is why the guest is not informed of it at check-in. Are we supposed to guess?? Also, the mini bars in the room are locked and inaccessible. They are also blaming it on COVID. According to the staff to minimize contamination. The communication between the front desk and the other departments (pool, bar, cafe) is zero to none. They are not in sync whatsoever. To top it all out, our room…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Returning to the Waldorf Astoria this year and was looking forward to the experience. A few days before our reservation, the hotel announced that it was opening and provided clear details about what to expect. This was greatly appreciated! However, when we arrived we began to experience little hiccups that ranged from annoyance to unacceptable.   At check-in we had to wait over an hour, after 4 PM, to get our room. While this was frustrating, the manager and front desk worked to keep all guests happy with champagne and F&B credits.   I was disappointed that the property decided to cut all housekeeping. While I want to keep all members of staff safe, there is little evidence that COVID can be spread in an empty room (even Dr Fauci still has his home cleaned by a cleaner). On top…"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Even during the pandemic, Waldorf has their signature luxury feel and excelling customer service.  Alex at the front desk gave us a great welcome. Extra cleaning precautions in place.  We’ll be back soon"
Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We’ve stayed at the Waldorf Astoria Las Vegas in the past so our expectations were reasonable.  I tried to call in advance of my stay to find out if the restaurants were open.  I must have called 20 times in the days prior - I could not get through to a live person.   I guess I should not have been surprised after checking in from our room and could NOT get ahold of the Front Desk, Housekeeping, Operator - NO ONE!    Sooo very disappointing and frustrating!    The guest room beds do not include sheets only comforters.  The line for the Zen Kitchen take-out was always long meaning that we waited 20 minutes just to place a to-go order only to wait 10 minutes longer for the kitchen to prepare it.  It serves a very abbreviated menu which I have attached. They no longer put…"
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Our suite had a GORGEOUS view of the new Raiders stadium, and our bed was literally the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. Our bathtub was big enough for me and my husband to both swim in at the same time! We had the best time at the hotel Casino, and the House of Blues restaurant was on point! We will definitely be back! "
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Great service great casino went to the pool and was fun... location of casino was perfect as to be in las  Vegas and the dealing with any crowds that were more up the strip .... I’ll be back! Thank you..
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"You should read and check the policy’s Before you book this hotel. there’s so many hidden fees they never mention the paying before and then paying after. I checked in it asked for a double payment,But I end up paying the fees Plus $300 due.Which is not my grand total then they  gonna tell me Paid the grand total after thatTaking my half of my money and I couldn’t  pay the grand total it was insane so I had to to cancel my room I didn’t have no money back  I had to call my family to take me back home I never want to be in Vegas no more.  P.s they had to really lovely suites "
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"If I could give a higher rating, I would. This is the only resort that I would prefer to stay in for our future Vegas vacations.  Rooms are unbelievable, pools are amazing, and comfort level is off the charts. "
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Beautiful hotel.  Quiet and I liked the lack of a casino.  Bell Staff was fantastic always super friendly and helpful. Strange thing was for such a wonderful hotel, the towels were like ones you get at a Motel that charges $50/night."
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,The rooms were nice. The staff was helpful. Make sure you stop by the spa on the second floor and enjoy. The restaurant had great food. It’s within reasonable distance from the strip everything is close.
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Overall an awesome stay at Delano. It was a family trip so I decided to book at the Delano because of the spacious rooms and the beach/pool at Mandalay Bay. The resort is huge, be prepared for some major walking.  My only complaint is that the shower had no hot water, but at least the soaking tub did. Also only the wave pool and the lazy river were open. The other 3 pools were closed."
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The stat itself was great very clean rooms, only bad part able room was asked for a refrigerator and they wanted $35 a night, the room had a refrigerator full of thing that was price so high I wanted to put a lock on it. Other then that the stay was great."
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,The overall stay was nice. The 2 bedroom suite was perfect for me and my girls. The decor was bright and clean. The bell desk was the only place I had an issue. They did not acknowledge us or offer to check our bags upon arrival. 
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"The 17th birthday next door to our room was ridiculous! We called security twice to quiet them down and get them out of the halls outside our door. They finally dissipated after about 4:30 am. Loud music and constant door slamming. At one point a drunk kid was FaceTiming right outside our door. If you’re going have to follow occupancy limits, maybe space the rooms out. We were right next door!"
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,Brought my service dog Great hotel Will go back next month Great food Friendly staff Amazing room Love the robes in room Love the bathroom Comfortable bed Beautiful look to hotel  Great pool  Love love this hotel 
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Fun, excellent, relaxing, needed to get away with my husband, everything was clean and comfortable, thank you for the awesome get away, we experienced a good and friendly stay at a wonderful hotel great time!"
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Hi everyone.  Well, we are back in my town again.  I don't live here but this is my town.  Yes it's mine!!! lol  Anyway This is our third  stay at an MGM property this year, second one during Covid.  After staying at the Park MGM, we decided to venture out and give another strip property a try. So here are my thoughts.....  The Delano is a beautiful hotel that is a quiet and peaceful retreat from what I expect would normally be a busy and crowded, though lovely, Mandalay Bay Resort.    Check in was easy and I was pleased to have bellmen service.  No valet still due to Covid, but you can drop off your luggage, check it with the bellman and then go park your car. As soon as you get your room, the bellman will bring up your luggage on a cart.  You can have him put it in  your room,…"
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,What a great find.  I actually booked this room thinking it was in the Mandalay Bay tower.  At first I was bummed when I got to the hotel I was more than ecstatic.  The lobby is VERY welcoming and warm with decor.  When getting to the room I found it to be wonderful size with great amenities.  We stayed in the King suite which had an extra half bath off of the living area.  That was a huge perk when we had some friends over for drinks.  There was no need for anyone to go to your bedroom to use the one in there.  The master bath was a wonderful size and the shower had a great amount of pressure.  The staff was courteous and helpful.  My wife loved the his and hers closets with more than enough wood hangers for both of us.  It was a bit of a walk to get to the beach area of the…
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Very LOUD hotel guests ruined our attempts at sleep.  They could be heard through the air vents. The staff was terrific.  M Life customer service was rude and unreasonable. We were offered a 4 night stay, used only 2 and then were charged $400 for a 3rd night. Even though we already had a another offer for 4 more nights. No way to treat Gold members. Going back to the Wynn!"
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Our stay went great. We did stay during the middle of the week and no issues were experienced. Keep in mind that this is during the covid-19 time. Parking was free during this time, checking in and out was as simple as ever. "
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Delano Hotel is a great place to enjoy time in Las Vegas, this Hotel has great rooms, living room with TV and nice bedroom with TV , refrigerator and two restrooms, luxury elegant place to walk around good parking location and beautiful swimming pools. "
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,I very much enjoyed my stay at this resort. The entire staff was really helpful and friendly. Also everything was incredibly clean and well kept up. I would definitely stay here again! The food was also amazing.
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"Strange room layout, far from almost everything and my scenic view suite had a far stretch from what I would consider to be a view. Hotel is newer and appears to be clean and kept up well but other than that I’d stay elsewhere. "
Delano Las Vegas,TripAdvisor,"We stayed at the Delano based on a promotion (comped room - just pay resort fees) we received via email.  We're happy we stayed here.  Free parking (limited time), large clean rooms.  We enjoyed our stay."
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"This was my 2nd stay at Nobu with my first stay back approx 6 months ago and it was just as amazing an experience as the first time.  Zoey, who was working the front desk, somehow recognized me from all those months ago, and immediately made me feel welcomed.  Due to some room availability, she upgraded me to a bigger room with me barely even asking.  She made my one night stay in Vegas unforgettable and I look forward to staying there again.  I won’t stay at another hotel in Vegas, only Nobu.... that’s how good this place is!"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Nobu was not what I expected. I went for a relaxing weekend, but it turned out to be the opposite.   1. The rooms were mediocre with peeling wallpapers.   2. The service was not what I expected. When I was asked how the trip was going by there concierge, Ivy, and brought my concerns to their attention I was replied with a generic cut and paste response that was no help.   3. Unable to use the pool. I got two rooms for me and my parents for the weekend and we weren’t able to go to the pool. Apparently we were supposed to go before 11 or make a reservation; yet no one mentioned it any one of us so we could plan accordingly.  4. Unexpected and inaccurate charges on final statement. I received multiple incorrect charges on my final statement and when I emailed Nobu, I did not receive a response.    The trip wasn’t that bad as the beds were comfy and the location was really good. Two weeks prior I stayed at four seasons where I was greeted by everyone on staff and they were extremely helpful!   Bottom line, there are so many better hotels for a comparable price such as Four seasons or Wynn with way better customer service. I will not be staying at this hotel again. …"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Clean and prompt service and had no problems whatsoever. Biggest complaint is no oversized parking for my truck so it was either park across the blvd at Bally's as the hotel suggested(terrible idea to suggest a 2-3 mile walk with luggage) or valet my truck at 30 a day plus tax, pretty steep."
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,I had the opportunity to stay at the nobu hotel im caesars. The rooms were really nice and the bathroom was pretty cool. I did not really like the small lobby and the elevator set up.   Zoey and the bellman on duty Yader were really nice and they were very accommodating.
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Let me start with how the Nobu staff checking us in were absolutely fantastic. The gentleman was quick and extremely professional in finding our reservation and giving us the low down of the place. We walked into a beautiful clean room with a great view. Ivy our personal concierge has greeted us and offered several times to accommodate our needs when they arise. I would absolutely recommend Nobu Hotel to everyone coming to Vegas. We will never stay anywhere else again. Great staff, clean facility, and just an awesome environment.  "
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,The shower would not get hot unless we ran the hot water in the tub. The front bathroom toilet would not stop running we called maintenance to fix took so long we had to fix it our self.   Front desk was really nice. 
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Stayed at Nobu @ CP during a very quick two day visit to Las Vegas. Caesars has done a good job updating the old Centurion Tower to the Nobu Hotel and I was quite surprised at the quality of the makeover. For starters, Nobu has its own check-in separate from CP. this is nice because you don’t have to stand in the often, gargantuan lines that form in the main lobby. However, it can also be bad because you have to walk through the often crowded hallway by Cleopatra’s Barge nightclub to get to the check-in. However, it wasn’t crowded when I arrived. Check-in was very quick. They now make it a practice to take the temperature of each guest before allowing you to proceed to your room, a COVID safety protocol-so be prepared. The Elevator bank and small check-in area are all contained…"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Wow. Y'all, Vegas is not the place to go during Covid, and Cesar's especially not the hotel. I will start with the only pro's - 1) Nobu Tower privacy is about as good as it gets for that place 2) the POOLS but only if you drop a grand on a day bed or cabana. The hotel is not fully functioning due to covid but they do not tell you that. The food options are TERRIBLE and expensive. I spent $600+ on dinner at Nobu and honestly, I could have gone to a local sushi spot for a quarter of the price and had better. The overall cleanliness is an issue and access to food and water!! OMG! WHy!!!! Vegas is not safe for Covid traveling, really hope my test results come back negative. The stay was going to be my first get-a-way in 8 months.....I am disappointed."
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Wonderful escape in the Sea of Las Vegas and Caesar's Palace. They could use some desks in the rooms, and some in house or room coffee in the Era of Covid! Great mattresses! Most importantly, the staff were exceptional, and their kind and helpful care was very much appreciated! Our favorite place in Vegas!!"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"I have stayed at Nobu in the past. In fact the last time was pre COVID in January of 2020.  This time was not near as satisfactory.  it all started with check in.  I booked my reservation online on the Nobu website.  I understand this is a ""different"" hotel than the Caesars and I prefer that.  Durning checkout there is an option to add a ""early check-in"" for 12pm.  Flying in from the East coast at 10:30Am it's really important to me to get in a room and have to wait till 3 or 4 PM.  At check in, as happens every time Ive come, ""the room is not ready"".  I informed the young lady that I paid for an early check in and showed her the email I got saying the early check in was approved.  She said: ""that is for Caesars, Nobu does not have an early check in option.""  Obviously I was…"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"My bf and I flew in for the Sunday night before Labor's Day.   We wanted a location that was close to the Chanel stores. Hotel was close to Bellagio.  It took us like 8 minutes to walk to Bellagio and 25 minutes to walk to the Wynn.   Nobu is pretty close to the front of the Caesar's entrance.  Room was nice, not very big.  Everything worked well.  The customer service was very nice.   We paid $50 to upgrade to the luxury room since our deluxe room was not ready yet and we wanted to checkin at 9AM.  Customer service was nice and helpful with all our questions.  Someone was always at the front desk when we passed by.   We got all dressed to go to the pool at 3:00 PM, when we got there we were told there is a virtual line and that we had to signup, it turns out the pool was at max…"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"We’ve stayed her several times because of proximity to Caesars sports book. Too bad that the COVID shut down time wasn’t used to make some needed updates. Notably, the carpet by the elevators in the lobby is worn and frayed around the edges by each elevator door. The first and last thing you see is a raggedy carpet. Given the expense of the rooms, you would expect better."
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,The site says you can check in as early as 9am. Not guaranteed but they will try. Then you arrive and they act like there is no way possible you would ever be able to check in before 4pm. We didn't set the expectation of that chance. The website did. Don't treat people like they are unreasonable when you put the potential on your website. Very bad business and horrible customer service. 
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"This was my first time staying at Caesars & I loved it! Nobu by far one of my new favorites in Vegas, its so clean & staff is professional & welcoming. For sure won’t be my last time. Can’t wait for my next trip"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Truly, only of our best stays in Las Vegas, was with the Nobu Hotel this past weekend, would 100% recommend. So accommodating and gracious. We felt so very taken care of. We will definitely return to this hotel."
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"I live here in Vegas and a few friends were in town to celebrate a birthday. Upon initial check-in at 4pm the rooms were not yet ready, I originally booked 2 queen rooms and their Sake suite for next night. We returned at 6pm to check on the status of the rooms. Kennedy said they were still not ready. We got our drinks out of our bags and they told us we could wait in their lounge and drink our drinks there, this is Vegas after all and we were here to celebrate. Through out all of this Kennedy was very polite, helpful and professional despite all of the not so pleasant customers. Kennedy guaranteed us that for the next night we could move directly from our rooms to the suite.  At that point, it started to seem ridiculous. I prepaid for our rooms and expected to check-in at 4pm,…"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,Located in the middle of Cesars is Nobu hotel. This high-end boutique hotel has well appointed guest rooms. Check in was FAST/no line. Priority reservations to Nobu restaurant when staying here. Definitely a hotel worth checking out!
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"I've been staying at the Hotel 6-7 times over the last 4 years where my first 3 stays were at the Sake Suite, Hakone Suite, then the smaller suite, and despite the latter being smaller, I completely found the room to be immensely charming.  That is, until our last stay where I was greeted by 3 cockroaches within a two night span on 3 different occasions.   Now, It's very sad for me to have to do this considering how I literally recommended the Nobu hotel to all my friends, which resulted in our stay at the Nobu Hotel just a few weeks back (July 25th, 2020).  Typically, I, a regular at the Nobu, was very quick to help Nobu cover their tracks with basic excuses such as ""ahhh, they've been closed due to the Covid so the cockroach predicament is unavoidable during these times."" …"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,"Nobu is a great hotel that I used to like to stay at when visiting LV. But my experience this weekend changed all that. After having to cancel because of the pandemic I rebooked. When I arrived I pointed out that per the “Best Price Guarantee” I was to get a lower room rate. Rather than being grateful of having a returning guest in lean times, the manager tried to argue that the “guarantee” only applies to the date you arrive. Not only is this inconsistent with the website but assumes people book trips on the day they leave without planning. Keep in mind this was for a measly $7 to $12 per night! I stayed Friday and Saturday. This is not to mention that they already charge $50 resort fee. So this is how you should expect to be treated as “family”. There are equally nice hotels…"
Nobu Hotel at Caesars Palace,TripAdvisor,JADE and her fellow team members at Nobu Las Vegas go above and beyond to make your stay a memorable and comfortable experience every time I visit.  Nobu is a quiet out of the way location with the most comfortable beds ever.  Nobu is my only choice when I’m in Vegas!
